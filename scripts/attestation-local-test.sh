#
# Local harness for attestation.
#
# Builds the Fastly adapter with a key schedule made for this run, runs it
# under Viceroy against a stub origin, and checks the evidence the way a
# verifier would: with the public key alone, over the context, a line feed
# and the payload. Everything it needs is generated into a temp directory;
# your `trusted-server.toml` is never read and your tracked `fastly.toml` is
# never modified. The keys are made here, used here and deleted with the
# directory.
#
# The build is given `TRUSTED_SERVER_ATTESTATION_KEYS`, so core is rebuilt
# with the schedule in it, and rebuilt again by the next build that is not
# given one. Run this after the other harnesses.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/attestation-local-test.sh
#
# Environment:
#   TS_BIN         a built `ts`, in place of building one
#   CARGO_TARGET_DIR  where cargo builds, when it is not `target`
#   ORIGIN_PORT    the stub origin's port
#   TS_PORT        the port Viceroy listens on
