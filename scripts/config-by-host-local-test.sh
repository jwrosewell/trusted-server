#
# Local harness for a service that reads one app-config blob for each host.
#
# Runs Trusted Server under Viceroy against three stub origins, one for each
# of two publishers and one behind the blob at the logical store ID, and
# asserts that every host is answered from its own blob and from no other.
# Everything it needs is generated into a temp directory; your
# `trusted-server.toml` is never read and your tracked `fastly.toml` is never
# modified.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/config-by-host-local-test.sh          # a fresh sandbox for each request
#   ./scripts/config-by-host-local-test.sh reuse    # one sandbox serves both publishers
#
# `reuse` builds with the reusable sandbox and sets its four bounds. Viceroy
# hands a waiting sandbox the next request, so the first requests of a run are
# served by one sandbox.
#
# Environment:
#   WASM_BINARY_PATH   a built adapter, in place of building one
#   TS_BIN             a built `ts`, in place of building one
#   ORIGIN_PORT        the first of three consecutive stub-origin ports
#   TS_PORT            the port Viceroy listens on
