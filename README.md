# Trusted Server

Trusted Server is an open-source, cloud based orchestration framework and runtime for publishers. It moves code execution and operations that traditionally occurs in browsers (via 3rd party JS) to secure, zero-cold-start WASM binaries running in WASI supported environments.

Trusted Server is the new execution layer for the open-web, returning control of 1st party data, security, and overall user-experience back to publishers.

## Quick Start

See the [Getting Started guide](https://iabtechlab.github.io/trusted-server/guide/getting-started) for installation and setup instructions.

```bash
# Build per adapter (target-matched aliases from .cargo/config.toml)
cargo build-fastly       # Fastly adapter + core (wasm32-wasip1)
cargo build-axum         # Axum dev server (native)
cargo build-cloudflare   # Cloudflare Workers (wasm32-unknown-unknown)

# Install the host-target CLI for your current platform
cargo install-cli

# If your shell cannot find `ts`, add Cargo's bin directory to PATH
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
ts --help

# Create local config, then edit placeholders before validation
ts config init
# Edit trusted-server.toml. Every pluggable component follows one syntax:
# [<type>] provider = "<name>" with settings in [<type>.<name>]. See the
# Configuration Rules guide linked above.
ts config validate

# Audit a public page with Chrome/Chromium to bootstrap a draft config
ts audit generate https://publisher.example

# Run tests (Fastly/WASM crates — requires Viceroy)
cargo test-fastly

# Run tests (Axum native adapter)
cargo test-axum

# Run tests (Cloudflare Workers adapter — native host)
cargo test-cloudflare

# Run tests (Spin adapter — native host)
cargo test-spin

# Start local server — Axum (no Fastly CLI or Viceroy required)
cargo run -p trusted-server-adapter-axum

# Start local server — Fastly (requires Fastly CLI + Viceroy)
fastly compute serve
```

## Development

```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Lint — use target-matched aliases (workspace has multiple WASM runtimes;
# broad --all-features clippy is not a reliable gate across adapters)
cargo clippy-fastly
cargo clippy-axum
cargo clippy-cloudflare
cargo clippy-spin-native
cargo clippy-spin-wasm

# Run all tests
cargo test-fastly      # Fastly/WASM (requires Viceroy)
cargo test-axum        # Axum native adapter
cargo test-cloudflare  # Cloudflare Workers adapter (native host)
cargo test-spin        # Spin adapter (native host)
```
