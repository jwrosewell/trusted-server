# Design Spec: Provider and Permission Model, Migration and Rollout

**Status:** Proposed. The implementation is carried by the series PRs #1043 to
#1047, none of which is yet merged to main, and this document was revised
against that series on 2026-08-25. The §8 sign-off rows remain the series'
decision ledger, and rows the implementation now satisfies are marked with
their PR so the task force can ratify rather than re-litigate. Updated on
2026-09-01, where `[geo] default_country` is retired and the fallback baseline
for a request with no resolvable country moves to the top node of the `rules:`
tree in `permissions.yaml`, where `jurisdiction` is a per-node inherited
attribute and the `consent.gdpr.applies_in` and
`consent.us_states.privacy_states` lists retire into the same tree
(permission-model spec §3.2, §3.4 and §12).

## The implemented series

Five stacked PRs, verified against the tree at
`split/5-response-hook-docs` (the head of PR #1047; the branch is rebuilt on
each rebase, so the PR is the stable reference). A sixth PR, #1084, adds the
integration provider seam spec on top of the series and changes no code:

1. **PR #1043, the Edge Cookie provider seam.** The `EdgeCookieProvider`
   trait (`id`, `generate`, `accepts_id`, `normalize_id_for_kv`,
   `required_permissions`, `resolve_from_client` in
   `crates/trusted-server-core/src/ec/provider.rs`) routes identifier
   creation, cookie read-back, and identity-graph keying through the
   selected provider. Global identifier bounds are enforced by core at every
   entry point (`MAX_EC_ID_LEN = 256` bytes and the cookie-safe alphabet
   `[A-Za-z0-9._~-]` in `ec/cookies.rs`), rejecting loudly and never
   rewriting, so the cookie value and the graph key cannot silently
   diverge. `[ec] provider = "none"` spells explicit statelessness. A
   configured `[ec.providers.*]` block with no selector, an unreferenced
   block, and a selector with no block are each startup errors. The
   deprecated `[ec] passphrase` form still starts for one release cycle,
   mapping to `provider = "hmac"` with a deprecation warning, and a
   configuration carrying both forms is rejected.
2. **PR #1044, device and geo selection.** `[device] provider` selects
   `builtin` (User-Agent only, the default) or the opt-in `fastly`
   classifier (`crates/device/fastly`, TLS JA4 and HTTP/2 signals).
   `[geo] provider` defaults to no geolocation, with `"platform"` opting in
   to the host lookup (`crates/geo/fastly`) and `"none"` spelling the
   opt-out. All four adapters route geo through the one
   `build_geo_provider` selector. The provider configuration structs carry
   `deny_unknown_fields`, so a mistyped key fails startup. The host-signal
   Edge Cookie provider (`[ec.providers.host-signals]`) ships opt-in.
   Whether the host-signal surface stays is an **open review question**
   (sign-off row 22), not a settled decision.
3. **PR #1045, the permission model.** Permission names follow the IAB
   Privacy Taxonomy Data Uses (`permissions.yaml`, compiled into the
   build). Signal precedence is fixed in code, most restrictive first,
   meaning an opt-out (Sec-GPC, GPP sale opt-out, US Privacy) suppresses
   the Data Uses the policy revokes even against a consenting TCF record,
   a present but undecodable record blocks baseline grants (fail-closed),
   and only then does a TCF record decide its mapped Data Uses.
   Destructive withdrawal is narrow, where only a TCF record refusing
   storage in a jurisdiction whose baseline did not grant storage expires
   the cookie and writes the identity-graph tombstone, and opt-outs never
   destroy an issued identifier. Sharing beyond the edge (bidstream
   `user.id`, the identify response, partner pull sync) requires storage
   plus personalised-ad selection, the same pair that gates bidstream
   EIDs. A fallback baseline for a request with no resolvable country
   becomes required, shipped as `[geo] default_country` and carried by the
   rules tree's top node since 2026-09-01, a failed geo lookup
   resolves at the requires-signal floor instead of that baseline, and a
   no-geo deployment running an Edge Cookie provider must set
   `[geo] assume_single_jurisdiction = true`.
4. **PR #1046, the hardened client-cycle resolve endpoint.**
   `POST /_ts/api/v1/ec/resolve` enforces publisher-origin `Origin` (403),
   a `text/plain` or `application/json` content-type allowlist (415), a
   body size cap (413), the global identifier bounds on the created
   identifier (400), and refusal to replace a different identity already on
   the request (409). The identity-graph row is written before the cookie
   is set, with no graph meaning no identifier is created and a graph
   write failure returning 503. Every response carries
   `Cache-Control: no-store`. A non-HttpOnly `ts-ecr` marker cookie tells
   the page script a resolve succeeded, fixing the re-post loop the
   HttpOnly Edge Cookie would otherwise cause, and a Rust test pins the
   marker name and the demo's fixed word against the page script source.
   The client-fixed demonstration provider compiles only under the
   `client-fixed-demo` cargo feature and production builds reject
   selecting the demo at startup.
5. **PR #1047, the documentation set.** Configuration reference for
   `[ec]`, `[device]`, and `[geo]`, the Edge Cookie guide rewritten around
   providers and the permission model, and the example configuration
   documenting every selector. The integration response-header hook was
   **stripped from the series** because the hook had no consumer, which is
   that spec's own rule for speculative surface. The hook spec is retained
   as the design bar for when its first consumer arrives.

## 1. Scope

Covers the transition of existing deployments from the hard-wired EC /
device / geo behavior to the provider architecture and permission model.
Applies to every implementation PR in the epic (now the implemented series
PRs #1043-#1047 and any follow-up), and to the operator-facing migration
guide that ships with the last of them (still outstanding, §7).

## 2. Behavior-preservation matrix

For each decision the system makes today, the target behavior after the
epic, and whether that is a preservation or a declared change. **Silent
changes are defects.** PR #838 changed six of these without declaring any.
The Status column now also records where the implemented series stands,
naming the PR. Rows the series did not touch keep their design-target text
for the follow-up work that will implement them.

Rows 3, 4, and 7 are policy decisions, not code decisions. In the
implemented series they live in `permissions.yaml`, which is compiled into
the build precisely so the policy stays visible and reviewable in version
control, made explicitly by maintainers rather than implied by an
implementation. The shipped defaults for rows 3 and 4 are flagged above for
the task force.

## 3. Identity stability guarantee

Today's EC identifier is `{64-hex}.{6-char}` where the 64-hex part is
deterministic, `HMAC-SHA256(passphrase, normalized_ip)`, and the 6-char
suffix is random per creation (an existing test asserts two creations
differ). Full identifiers are therefore not reproducible by design, and no
test may pretend otherwise. What stability means, precisely, for a
deployment that selects `provider = "hmac"` and carries its passphrase over
verbatim, with where the series stands on each:

- **The deterministic prefix is stable per inputs.** Implemented and
  tested (#1043,
  `generate_hmac_ec_id_is_stable_per_parts_and_collision_resistant`).
  The committed known-answer vector the draft required (fixed passphrase
  plus IP → exact expected 64-hex prefix, failing CI on divergence) is
  **not yet committed** and remains open work.
- **Existing cookies stay parseable.** The `is_valid_ec_id` shape check is
  unchanged and the HMAC provider's `accepts_id` delegates to that check,
  so pre-series `ts-ec` values keep resolving and their graph rows (keyed
  through `normalize_id_for_kv`, which lowercases the hash exactly as the
  pre-series normalization did) remain reachable.
- **The hash prefix keeps its semantics.** `ec_hash` remains the 64-hex
  prefix, preserving both its stability and its deliberate collision
  across identifiers created from the same IP.
- **Cookie name, attributes, and max-age are unchanged.** `ts-ec`,
  `Domain` derived from the publisher domain, `Path=/`, `Secure`,
  `SameSite=Lax`, `HttpOnly`, one-year `Max-Age` (`ec/cookies.rs`).
- **New global bounds (#1043), a declared addition.** Every identifier,
  whatever provider created the value, must fit 256 bytes and
  `[A-Za-z0-9._~-]`. Out-of-bounds identifiers are rejected loudly and
  never rewritten.

## 4. Configuration migration

Old shape:

```toml
[ec]
passphrase = "replace-with-32-plus-byte-random-secret"
```

New shape:

```toml
[ec]
provider = "hmac"

[ec.providers.hmac]
passphrase = "replace-with-32-plus-byte-random-secret"
```

Requirements, each marked with its implementation state:

1. **The transition has a dual-read release, and loud rejection comes one
   release later.** Implemented (#1043) in the simple form, where the
   current release accepts the old shape, mapping `[ec] passphrase` to the
   `hmac` provider internally and logging a deprecation warning per
   startup, and accepts the new shape. A configuration mixing the two
   forms is rejected, not reconciled. Ordering remains strictly
   reader-first, because pre-series binaries reject the new `[ec]` keys
   and the new `[device]` / `[geo]` sections as unknown fields, so a fleet
   converges binaries first and flips configuration second. The follow-on
   release that rejects `[ec] passphrase` outright with a message naming
   the new location is scheduled, not yet in the tree.

   The draft's full N+1/N+2 interim (the negative-record read/write
   matrix, the `permissions_v2` model promotion, the `m00` mirror, and the
   rollback-floor machinery) is **deferred** together with the durable
   suppression design that motivates all of that machinery (sign-off rows
   11, 16, 19, 20). The series needs none of that machinery because the
   only durable negative artifact today is the identity-graph withdrawal
   tombstone the pre-series lifecycle already wrote, so a binary rollback
   strands no new state. The interim matrix stays recorded in row 20 as
   the design bar for when durable suppression ships.

2. **Adapter qualification is a pre-ratification prerequisite.**
   **Deferred.** No machine-readable capability matrix exists. The
   series' de facto posture is that the identity endpoints (resolve,
   identify, batch sync) route only on the Fastly adapter, and the other
   adapters run without them, which is the stateless-identity path of
   requirement 3. PSL vendoring and the pinned GPP corpus (draft
   requirement text) remain prerequisites of the response-hook and GPP
   follow-ups respectively (sign-offs 23, 28, 32).
3. **Revocation-eligible storage is a per-adapter gate, and ungated
   adapters migrate stateless.** Direction implemented, since
   `provider = "none"` spells explicit statelessness (#1043) and
   non-Fastly adapters deliberately do not route the identity endpoints
   (#1046), matching identify and batch sync. The formal per-adapter
   capability gate is deferred with requirement 2 (sign-off 12).
4. **The graphless migration.** **Superseded in the series.** No
   graphless flag, stub backfill, or rowless classification exists, and
   the draft's 4b startup requirement (a creating provider must have an
   openable graph store at boot) did not ship. The implemented rule is
   request-scoped, where no available identity graph means no identifier
   is created, on the organic path and on resolve alike, so a graphless
   deployment runs identity-less rather than failing startup (§2 row 12).
   The rowless design returns, if at all, with sign-offs 21, 29, and 30.
5. **The graph schema change is expand-contract.** **Deferred.** Rows
   carry the existing schema. No provider/version field, per-permission
   provenance, policy revision, family ID, model epoch, or rollback floor
   ships in the series. This work belongs to the durable-suppression and
   provenance follow-up (sign-offs 11, 16, 19, 20, 25).
6. **Half-migrated fails loud.** Implemented (#1043). An
   `[ec.providers.hmac]` block with no `provider = "hmac"` selector is a
   startup error, as is a selector whose block is absent and an
   unreferenced block alongside a different selection. The exact state
   that validated green and silently created zero ECs in PR #838 now
   refuses to start.
7. **PR #838-era keys.** **Revised.** The draft required rejecting
   `provider = "host-signals"` and `provider = "client-fixed"` as unknown
   keys. The series instead ships both deliberately. `host-signals` is a
   supported opt-in selection (#1044) pending the sign-off 22 review, and
   `client-fixed` exists only under the `client-fixed-demo` cargo feature
   with production builds rejecting the selection at startup (#1046).
   Genuinely unknown keys still fail loud through the unknown-selector
   error and `deny_unknown_fields`.
8. **Provider switches go through legacy readers.** **Deferred.** No
   `legacy_providers` mechanism exists. Today a provider switch on a
   deployment with live identities strands the outgoing provider's
   cookies (the new provider's `accepts_id` rejects them and identity
   restarts). The reader-chain design remains the bar for when a second
   server-side provider makes switching real.
9. **The example config ships the migrated shape.** **Revised.** The
   example ships Edge Cookie identity off by default, with each selector
   and its block documented together and commented together, and the
   fallback baseline stated in `permissions.yaml` rather than left to the
   reader. The draft wanted the happy path
   uncommented. The series instead closes PR #838's silent-stateless trap
   by validation (requirement 6), so a half-uncommented configuration
   refuses to start rather than running stateless. Static-geo examples
   pair the rules tree's top node with the commented
   `assume_single_jurisdiction` acknowledgment, which startup enforces
   whenever an EC provider runs with no geo provider (#1045).
10. Every misconfiguration in the providers spec §6 table fails at
    **startup**. Implemented for configuration errors (#1043-#1045:
    selector/block mismatches, unknown keys, unknown selector values,
    a top node missing its `group` or `jurisdiction`, missing
    acknowledgment, demo provider in a production build). The pre-series passphrase minimum and placeholder
    rejection carry over unchanged. One residual is declared. A
    selected vendor or host provider the running adapter does not inject
    fails per request, loudly, because adapter injection is a build fact
    the settings layer cannot see. Closing that residual belongs to the
    capability-matrix follow-up (requirement 2).
11. Validation is split into two named layers. Partially implemented.
    Structural validation runs at `ts config push` / `ts config validate`
    (the CLI deserializes and validates the typed settings, with a
    regression test covering environment overlays) and again at startup,
    and startup additionally validates deployment facts only startup can
    see (provider availability in the build, the top node of the rules tree
    in the compiled `permissions.yaml`, the acknowledgment rule). The
    machine-readable adapter capability profile for push-time deployment
    pre-checks is deferred with requirement 2.

## 5. Minimal-divergence migration recipe (operator-facing)

"Keep exactly today's behavior" is not fully achievable, and the recipe's
name says so. The divergences that actually shipped in the series, each a
matrix row: global honoring of mapped opt-outs (row 8), an authoritative
TCF refusal blocking new grants everywhere (row 6), the protective
geo-failure floor (row 5), country-wide protective US handling (row 3f),
malformed-present blocking acquisition (row 3c), and the shipped `granted`
US and GB storage baselines (rows 3 and 4, flagged for ratification).
Divergences the draft listed that have **not** shipped and remain deferred:
the sharing/targeted GPP fields (row 3e), the grant-signal class (row 3a,
now stricter instead), and the batch-sync provenance gate (row 11c).

Policy now lives in a permissions YAML document (the repository sample is
`config/permissions/vanilla.yaml`), compiled into the build. There is
no `[permissions]` block in `trusted-server.toml`, so the draft's
partial-policy trap (a TOML table containing only a permissive default)
cannot be written at all. A deployer edits the yaml and rebuilds, which
keeps every policy change reviewable in version control. The shipped
default policy maps the EU-27 plus the EEA states to `gdpr-eu` (a signal
required for every modeled use), GB to `gdpr-uk` (storage `granted`,
flagged in row 4), and US and AU to `us-opt-out` (a `granted` baseline
where all granted uses drop on any opt-out signal), leaves every unmodeled
Data Use `denied`, and sends unmatched requests to the group named at the top
of the required rules tree.

The migrated operator configuration is:

- `[ec] provider = "hmac"` with its `[ec.providers.hmac]` block (32-plus
  character passphrase), carried over verbatim for identity stability
  (§3);
- `[device]` left at the `builtin` default, with `fastly` as the opt-in
  documented alongside the open sign-off 22 question;
- `[geo] provider = "platform"` where the adapter supplies a host lookup
  (Fastly and Cloudflare in production, the Axum dev server in
  development, while Spin resolves nothing either way). A selected
  provider's lookup failure resolves at the requires-signal floor and
  never at the fallback baseline. A static deployment instead states its
  group at the top of the rules tree together with
  `assume_single_jurisdiction = true`;
- the `permissions.yaml` rules tree carrying a top node with a `group` and a
  `jurisdiction` (required), with each country or region below stating its own
  `jurisdiction` only where it differs from the node above. The operator no
  longer carries `consent.gdpr.applies_in` or `consent.us_states.privacy_states`,
  because the shipped tree holds the same 31 GDPR countries and the same 20
  privacy-law states.

The draft's committed per-adapter fixture files
(`docs/guide/fixtures/migration-preserving-<adapter>.toml`, CI-validated
and pinned against the §2 preservation rows) are **not yet written** and
remain the bar for the migration guide (§7). The guide must also state
that no recipe preserves row 8, because the global honoring of opt-out
signals is unconditional in the shipped model.

## 6. Rollout sequence and observability

1. Implementation PRs land in the epic's order. **Done as specified.**
   The series landed providers first with the geo default held at today's
   behavior (#1044), and the permission model PR flipped the default
   together with its jurisdiction guard (#1045). Each PR's description
   states what that PR changes.
2. **Adapter qualification as a release gate.** **Deferred** with §4
   requirement 2. The series' posture is the declared stateless-identity
   path for adapters without the identity endpoints. The response hook
   remains outside the series entirely (#1047).
3. **Staged activation for policy publication.** **Deferred** (sign-off
   19). `ts config push` today publishes the operator configuration as a
   blob envelope and validates the configuration. The immutable
   `push_sequence` envelope, prepare/commit activation, admission lease,
   quiescence barrier, and scheduled-unavailability protocol are not
   implemented. Policy in the shipped series changes by rebuilding
   (`permissions.yaml`) or by pushing configuration, both taking effect
   on restart/reload rather than through a fleet-wide activation CAS.
4. Before/after deploy, operators watch **EC issuance rate** and EID
   attachment rate as the canary metrics, because the failure mode of a
   bad migration is a silent drop to zero (or a silent grant to
   everyone), not an error rate. **The named metric set with thresholds,
   windows, and actions is not yet built.** The requirement stands for
   the migration guide. The retirement-readiness bar for a legacy
   provider (legacy-reader hits at zero for a quiet period no shorter
   than the maximum cookie/row lifetime plus rollout skew) transfers to
   the deferred `legacy_providers` design (§4 requirement 8).
5. Startup logs. Partially implemented. Startup logs the effective
   default baseline and the exact list of permissions granted without a
   signal, plus the passphrase deprecation warning. That line named
   `[geo] default_country` when it was written, and it names the rules
   tree's top node from 2026-09-01.
   The single greppable line naming the selected provider per concern and
   whether geo is live remains to add.
6. **The batch-sync coverage dip.** **Deferred** with the provenance
   gate (row 11c, sign-offs 7, 13, 25). Today batch sync authenticates
   the caller and checks row state, and rows that are missing or
   withdrawn collapse to ineligible. There is still no fail-open
   shortcut, and grandfathering pre-epic identities past the permission
   model remains rejected.
7. Rollback is config-only where possible. Implemented in the simple
   sense, where selection is configuration, so reverting to the previous
   configuration on the previous binary restores the previous behavior,
   and the same compiled binary switches providers through the
   `TRUSTED_SERVER__ec__provider` / `TRUSTED_SERVER__device__provider` /
   `TRUSTED_SERVER__geo__provider` overrides applied when the operator
   publishes configuration through `ts config push`. The durable
   artifacts today are exactly the **identity-graph withdrawal
   tombstones** written by explicit storage withdrawal (no recovery, that
   is their purpose). The draft's longer durable list (model epoch tuple,
   use-opt-out suppressions, negative outbox, safety breaker) describes
   the deferred durable-suppression design (sign-offs 11, 16, 19, 20).
   The two documented-not-automated procedures (cleanup after a policy
   tightening, legacy-reader retirement) remain for the migration guide.

### 6.1 Operator CLI delta for this epic

The pre-existing CLI design remains unchanged and is what the series
uses. `ts config push` validates and publishes the operator configuration
(with typed environment overlays covered by a CLI regression test), and
`ts config validate` runs the same structural validation standalone.

The draft's normative delta to `ts config push` (never-reused
`push_sequence`, immutable envelope identity, candidate CAS, §5.5
promotion protocol) and the `ts config gc` command are **not
implemented**. They are deferred together with sign-off 19 and remain the
design bar for the durable-suppression and staged-activation follow-up.
Nothing in the series authorizes a generic raw metadata command or a
model-transition command.

## 7. Documentation deliverables

- Migration guide page (§5), linked from `CHANGELOG.md` and the release
  notes. **Outstanding.** The series updated `configuration.md`,
  `edge-cookies.md`, `ec-setup-guide.md`, and `error-reference.md`
  (#1047), and the example configuration documents every selector, but
  the dedicated migration page with per-adapter fixtures and the
  CHANGELOG link do not exist yet.
- `configuration.md` documents **every** valid `provider` value for all
  three concerns. **Done** (#1047), including the required fallback
  baseline (`default_country` at the time, the rules tree's top node since
  2026-09-01), the acknowledgment flag, and the requires-signal
  floor on a failed lookup. The environment-variable overrides are now
  real in production, applied as typed EdgeZero app-config overlays when
  the operator publishes through `ts config push`, with a CLI regression
  test. (In PR #838 the documented override existed only under
  `#[cfg(test)]`. The core test-only helper survives as legacy, and the
  runtime path does not use that helper.)
- The permission model page states the precedence rules the code
  implements. **Done** (#1045/#1047). The permission-model guide is in
  the docs navigation, and the precedence is fixed in code (opt-out over
  TCF, malformed-present fail-closed, then TCF), with pinning tests per
  opt-out source against a consenting TCF record. Operator docs and
  normative spec must not diverge on precedence.

## 8. Product decisions requiring explicit sign-off

These are product decisions this spec set needs that #838 had not already
made (or made differently). The table records the recommended resolution
approved for this spec revision, not a final product decision.
**Implementation is blocked while any row is `open`.** Each row is a
decision, not an assignment, since who decided is captured inside the
record itself (`docs/superpowers/specs/decisions/NN-title.md`, the
decision, the deciders, the date). The Decision-record column holds the
link (`(none)` while open). An unratified row reverts to open, not to
silently implemented. **The implemented series (PRs #1043-#1047) is
presented to the task force for ratification of the rows marked below as
implemented or bearing on the series**, so the task force can ratify
rather than re-litigate. Ratifying such a row creates its decision record
and closes the row. Rejecting one reverts the implementation, never keeps
the code with the row open.
