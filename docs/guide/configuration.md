# Configuration

Learn how to configure Trusted Server for your deployment.

## Overview

Trusted Server uses a flexible configuration system based on:

1. **TOML Files** - `trusted-server.toml` for base configuration
2. **Environment Variables** - Typed CLI overrides with the `TRUSTED_SERVER__` prefix
3. **Fastly Stores** - KV/Config/Secret stores for runtime data

## Quick Start

### Minimal Configuration

Create `trusted-server.toml` in your project root:

```toml
[publisher]
domain = "publisher.com"
cookie_domain = ".publisher.com"
origin_url = "https://origin.publisher.com"
proxy_secret = "your-secure-secret-here"

[ec]
provider = "hmac"

[ec.providers.hmac]
passphrase = "replace-with-32-plus-byte-random-secret"
```

### Environment Variable Overrides

Environment variables are merged into existing TOML values by the typed
`ts config validate`, `ts config diff`, and `ts config push` flows. They are not
read by the deployed application at request time.

```bash
# Format: TRUSTED_SERVER__SECTION__FIELD
export TRUSTED_SERVER__PUBLISHER__DOMAIN=publisher.com
export TRUSTED_SERVER__PUBLISHER__ORIGIN_URL=https://origin.publisher.com
export TRUSTED_SERVER__EC__PROVIDER=hmac
export TRUSTED_SERVER__EC__PROVIDERS__HMAC__PASSPHRASE=replace-with-32-plus-byte-random-secret

ts config validate
ts config push --adapter fastly
```

### Generate Secure Secrets

```bash
# Generate cryptographically random secrets
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### Strict Key Validation

Trusted Server rejects unknown TOML keys in runtime configuration. Before pushing
or upgrading config, remove stale fields and typos; otherwise config loading can
fail and the service will return its startup-error response.

## Detailed Reference

The sections below consolidate the full configuration reference on this page.

## Environment Variable Overrides (Typed CLI)

Environment variables with the `TRUSTED_SERVER__` prefix are merged into the
base TOML configuration by `ts config validate`, `ts config diff`, and
`ts config push`. The resolved values are validated and, for `config push`,
stored in the app-config blob. Changing an environment variable requires
rerunning validation and pushing the resolved config, not rebuilding the binary.

EdgeZero's env overlay only overrides leaves that already exist in the parsed TOML; it
does not create missing fields. Add newly introduced defaulted fields to an
existing config before relying on their environment overrides. Pass `--no-env`
to use file values without the overlay.

### Format

```
TRUSTED_SERVER__SECTION__SUBSECTION__FIELD
```

**Rules**:

- Prefix: `TRUSTED_SERVER`
- Separator: `__` (double underscore)
- Case: UPPERCASE
- Sections: Match TOML hierarchy

### Examples

**Simple Field**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__PUBLISHER__DOMAIN=publisher.com
```

**Nested Field**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__PREBID__SERVER_URL=https://prebid.example/auction
```

**Array Field (JSON)**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__PREBID__BIDDERS='["kargo","rubicon"]'
```

**Array Field (Indexed)**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__PREBID__BIDDERS__0=kargo
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__PREBID__BIDDERS__1=rubicon
```

**Array Field (Comma-Separated)**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__PREBID__BIDDERS=kargo,rubicon,appnexus
```

## Publisher Configuration

Core publisher settings for domain, origin, and proxy configuration.

### `[publisher]`

| Field                         | Type    | Required | Description                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `domain`                      | String  | Yes      | Publisher's apex domain name                                                |
| `cookie_domain`               | String  | Yes      | Domain for non-EC cookies (typically with leading dot)                      |
| `origin_url`                  | String  | Yes      | Full URL of publisher origin server                                         |
| `origin_host_header_override` | String  | No       | Outbound Host header to send while connecting to `origin_url`               |
| `proxy_secret`                | String  | Yes      | Secret key for encrypting/signing proxy URLs                                |
| `max_buffered_body_bytes`     | Integer | No       | Buffered-body cap / Fastly stream raw+decoded byte ceiling (default 16 MiB) |

> **Note:** EC cookies (`ts-ec`) derive their domain automatically as `.{domain}` and
> do not use `cookie_domain`. The `cookie_domain` field is used by other cookie helpers.

**Example**:

```toml
[publisher]
domain = "publisher.com"
cookie_domain = ".publisher.com"
origin_url = "https://origin.publisher.com"
# Optional: connect to origin_url but send this outbound Host header.
# origin_host_header_override = "www.publisher.com"
proxy_secret = "change-me-to-secure-random-value"
```

**Environment Override**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__PUBLISHER__DOMAIN=publisher.com
TRUSTED_SERVER__PUBLISHER__COOKIE_DOMAIN=.publisher.com
TRUSTED_SERVER__PUBLISHER__ORIGIN_URL=https://origin.publisher.com
TRUSTED_SERVER__PUBLISHER__ORIGIN_HOST_HEADER_OVERRIDE=www.publisher.com
TRUSTED_SERVER__PUBLISHER__PROXY_SECRET=your-secret-here
TRUSTED_SERVER__PUBLISHER__MAX_BUFFERED_BODY_BYTES=16777216
```

### Field Details

#### `domain`

**Purpose**: Primary domain for the publisher.

**Usage**:

- Used for publisher routing and logging
- Part of request context for proxy/origin handling

**Format**: Hostname without protocol or path

- ✅ `publisher.com`
- ✅ `www.publisher.com`
- ❌ `https://publisher.com`
- ❌ `publisher.com/path`

#### `cookie_domain`

**Purpose**: Domain scope for non-EC cookies.

**Usage**:

- Used by non-EC cookie helpers for domain scoping
- EC cookies (`ts-ec`) use a separate computed domain derived from `domain`

**Format**: Domain with optional leading dot

- `.publisher.com` - Shares across all subdomains
- `publisher.com` - Exact domain only

**Best Practice**: Use leading dot (`.publisher.com`) for subdomain sharing.

#### `origin_url`

**Purpose**: Backend origin server URL for publisher content.

**Usage**:

- Fallback proxy target for non-integration requests
- HTML processing rewrites origin URLs to request host
- Base for relative URL resolution

**Format**: Full URL with protocol

- ✅ `https://origin.publisher.com`
- ✅ `https://origin.publisher.com:8080`
- ✅ `http://192.168.1.1:9000`
- ❌ `origin.publisher.com` (missing protocol)

**Port Handling**: Includes port if non-standard (not 80/443).

#### `origin_host_header_override`

**Purpose**: Optional Host header to send to the publisher origin while still
connecting to the host in `origin_url`.

**Usage**:

- Connects, uses SNI, and checks certificates against `origin_url`
- Sends the configured value as the outbound HTTP `Host` header
- Useful when the origin endpoint expects a canonical publisher hostname

**Format**: Hostname with optional port, without protocol, path, query, or fragment

- ✅ `www.publisher.com`
- ✅ `www.publisher.com:8443`
- ❌ `https://www.publisher.com`
- ❌ `www.publisher.com/path`

**Default**: When omitted, Trusted Server sends the host from `origin_url`.

#### `proxy_secret`

**Purpose**: Secret key for HMAC-SHA256 signing of proxy URLs.

**Security**:

- Keep confidential and secure
- Rotate periodically (90 days recommended)
- Use cryptographically random values (32+ bytes)
- Never commit to version control

**Generation**:

```bash
# Generate secure random secret
openssl rand -base64 32
```

**Usage**:

- Signs `/first-party/proxy` URLs
- Signs `/first-party/click` URLs
- Validates incoming proxy requests
- Prevents URL tampering

::: danger Security Warning
Changing `proxy_secret` invalidates all existing signed URLs. Plan rotations carefully and use graceful transition periods.
:::

#### `max_buffered_body_bytes`

**Purpose**: Upper bound on how much of a publisher origin body the rewrite
pipeline holds in memory — the post-rewrite output buffer on buffered adapters,
and the per-stream raw/decoded byte ceiling on the Fastly streaming path.

**Usage**:

- On **buffered adapters** (Axum, Cloudflare, Spin) it caps the _decoded,
  post-rewrite_ output buffer for a publisher response processed in full. It
  also bounds how much decoded gzip output may sit in the heap at any one
  moment, so a decompression bomb is rejected mid-decode rather than after its
  full expansion. That second bound is per-step, not a total: a gzip-encoded
  response passes or fails on the same post-rewrite output size as the identity,
  deflate and brotli versions of the same body.
- On the **Fastly streaming path** the origin body is preserved as a stream, so
  the same value caps the stream twice over: the cumulative _raw_ (still
  compressed) bytes pulled from origin, and the cumulative _decoded_ bytes
  emitted by the decompressor. The decoded cap is enforced _during_
  decompression, so a decompression bomb is rejected before its expansion is
  materialized rather than after.

**Behavior when exceeded**:

- On **buffered adapters** the response fails before any bytes are committed.
- On the **streaming path** the response headers are already committed when
  either cap trips, so the body is **truncated mid-stream** and the error is
  logged — the client receives a short (incomplete) body rather than a `5xx`.
  Size the cap above your largest expected decoded page so legitimate responses
  are never truncated.

**Default**: `16777216` (16 MiB). On the Fastly streaming path this is now the
sole ceiling: origin bodies are streamed rather than materialized in full, so
the previous ~10 MiB raw-body limit no longer applies.

**Minimum**: Must be at least `1`. A value of `0` is rejected at startup because
a zero-byte cap fails every non-empty publisher response.

**Environment Override**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__PUBLISHER__MAX_BUFFERED_BODY_BYTES=16777216
```

## Trusted Client IP Configuration

Use this optional section when a trusted CDN service forwards requests to the
Fastly service running Trusted Server. It lets Trusted Server use the reader's
address instead of the immediate fronting edge node's address. Only the Fastly
adapter honours this section; the Cloudflare, Spin, and Axum adapters validate
it but keep using their own runtime client address.

### `[trusted_client_ip]`

| Field           | Type   | Required | Description                                                                       |
| --------------- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ip_header`     | String | Yes      | Header containing exactly one reader IP address                                   |
| `auth_header`   | String | Yes      | Header containing exactly one shared-secret value                                 |
| `shared_secret` | String | Yes      | Secret shared with the trusted front door, 32+ ASCII graphic bytes, no whitespace |

All three fields are required when the section exists. When the section is
absent, Trusted Server continues to use the immediate peer address, and
`ts config push` omits the section from the published config blob so instances
running an older binary keep accepting the blob.

::: warning Deploy the code before pushing the config
Once the section is configured, the pushed blob carries it, and `Settings`
rejects unknown fields. A binary that predates trusted client-IP support fails
to load a blob containing this section and returns its startup-error response.
Upgrade every instance before pushing a config that enables the section, and
restore a config without the section before rolling instances back. Getting
this order wrong takes the service down rather than degrading it.
:::

```toml
[trusted_client_ip]
ip_header = "x-ts-client-ip"
auth_header = "x-ts-client-ip-auth"
shared_secret = "replace-with-a-random-shared-secret"
```

Prefer a dedicated `x-` name for `ip_header`, as shown. `fastly-client-ip` is
also accepted and suits a fronting service dedicated to Trusted Server, but on
a service carrying other traffic a dedicated name means the front door never
modifies `Fastly-Client-IP`, so other consumers of that header keep working
unchanged. See [Fastly Setup](/guide/fastly#cdn-fronted-client-ip) for the
front-door configuration this section depends on.

The front door must overwrite both headers on every request it forwards to
Trusted Server, and must remove client-supplied copies on its other routes.
Trusted Server accepts the forwarded address only when the request has exactly
one `auth_header` value that matches `shared_secret` byte-for-byte and exactly
one `ip_header` value that parses directly as IPv4 or IPv6. Values are not
trimmed or normalized. Missing, empty, duplicate, non-UTF-8, mismatched, or malformed
values do not reject the request; Trusted Server safely falls back to the
immediate peer address. Both configured headers are removed before routing.

Header names are validated case-insensitively. `ip_header` must be
`fastly-client-ip` or start with `x-`, while `auth_header` must start with `x-`.
The names must differ. Neither field may use a header name reserved for
Trusted Server's own internal signals (for example `x-forwarded-for`,
`x-geo-info-available`, `x-ts-ec`, `x-ts-tls-protocol`, or `x-ts-tls-cipher`);
the full reserved set is the internal-header list that Trusted Server strips
before forwarding to third parties. These restrictions exclude standard
sensitive headers such as `Host`, `Content-Length`, `Cookie`, and
`Authorization`, as well as every Trusted Server internal header. Choose
dedicated `x-` names that no other application or routing logic uses, because
Trusted Server removes the configured headers before routing.

Generate `shared_secret` with a cryptographically secure random generator,
encode it as hex or base64url, store the same value only in the front door and
Trusted Server configuration, and never commit it. The value is redacted from
configuration debug output. Configuration requires at least 32 ASCII graphic
bytes (`!` through `~`) with no whitespace, controls, DEL, or non-ASCII bytes,
and startup fails when the value is still the documented placeholder.

Independently of this section, the Fastly adapter treats `fastly-client-ip` as
client-spoofable and strips it at request entry, so Trusted Server no longer
forwards an inbound `Fastly-Client-IP` to the publisher origin. This applies
even when `[trusted_client_ip]` is absent. Check whether the origin reads that
header before deploying.

Redaction protects debug output and validation errors; it does not move the
value into a platform secret store. `ts config push` serializes the value in the
Trusted Server application-config blob, so restrict access to that configuration
store. Every adapter removes the configured IP and authentication headers before
routing, although only Fastly uses them for client-IP resolution.

**Environment Overrides**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__TRUSTED_CLIENT_IP__IP_HEADER=x-ts-client-ip
TRUSTED_SERVER__TRUSTED_CLIENT_IP__AUTH_HEADER=x-ts-client-ip-auth
TRUSTED_SERVER__TRUSTED_CLIENT_IP__SHARED_SECRET=replace-with-a-random-shared-secret
```

Because the typed environment overlay cannot create a missing section, add
`[trusted_client_ip]` and all three fields to the TOML before using these
overrides.

## Tester Cookie Configuration

Settings for the optional tester-cookie endpoints. This feature is disabled by
default and should only be enabled for intentional QA or troubleshooting flows.

### `[tester_cookie]`

| Field     | Type    | Required | Description                                        |
| --------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled` | Boolean | No       | Enables routes to set and clear `ts-tester` cookie |

When enabled, `GET /_ts/set-tester` returns `204 No Content` and sets:

```http
Set-Cookie: ts-tester=true; Domain=<publisher.cookie_domain>; Path=/; Secure; SameSite=Lax
Cache-Control: no-store, private
```

`GET /_ts/clear-tester` returns `204 No Content` and clears the cookie:

```http
Set-Cookie: ts-tester=; Domain=<publisher.cookie_domain>; Path=/; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Max-Age=0
Cache-Control: no-store, private
```

When disabled, both routes return `404 Not Found` and do not set a cookie.

::: warning
The cookie is scoped with `[publisher].cookie_domain`, not the EC-specific
computed domain. Keep `cookie_domain` aligned with the browser scope where your
QA tooling expects to read `ts-tester`.
:::

**Example**:

```toml
[tester_cookie]
enabled = true
```

**Environment Override**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__TESTER_COOKIE__ENABLED=true
```

## EC Configuration

Settings for Edge Cookie identifier generation. The `ec_store` KV store is the only KV-backed EC lifecycle store. It holds identity graph state, minimal consent metadata, source-domain keyed partner UIDs, and withdrawal tombstones. Consent configuration controls request-local interpretation and forwarding, not separate KV persistence.

### `[ec]`

| Field                     | Type           | Required | Description                                                                                               |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `provider`                | String or null | No       | Key of the active Edge Cookie provider, for example `"hmac"`. Omit to run statelessly with no Edge Cookie |
| `ec_store`                | String or null | No       | Fastly KV store name for EC identity graph and withdrawal state                                           |
| `pull_sync_concurrency`   | Integer        | No       | Maximum concurrent pull-sync requests per organic response                                                |
| `cluster_trust_threshold` | Integer        | No       | Cluster size threshold for identity trust decisions                                                       |
| `cluster_recheck_secs`    | Integer        | No       | Legacy compatibility setting; cluster rechecks no longer use timestamps                                   |
| `partners`                | Array          | No       | Static partner registry entries                                                                           |

The selected `provider` must have a matching `[ec.providers.<key>]` block. Selecting a provider with no configured block, or an unknown key, fails at startup.

### `[ec.providers.hmac]`

The built-in HMAC-over-client-IP provider, keyed `hmac`.

| Field        | Type   | Required                    | Description                               |
| ------------ | ------ | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `passphrase` | String | Yes when `hmac` is selected | Publisher passphrase used as the HMAC key |

::: tip Partner keying
`source_domain` is the canonical partner key. It matches incoming OpenRTB EID `source` values and is also used as the EC KV `ids` map key.
:::

**Example**:

```toml
[ec]
provider = "hmac"
ec_store = "ec_identity_store"

[ec.providers.hmac]
passphrase = "replace-with-32-plus-byte-random-secret"

[[ec.partners]]
name = "Mocktioneer SSP"
source_domain = "mocktioneer.example"
api_token = "partner-api-token-32-bytes-minimum"
bidstream_enabled = true
```

**Environment Override**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__EC__PROVIDER=hmac
TRUSTED_SERVER__EC__PROVIDERS__HMAC__PASSPHRASE=your-secret
TRUSTED_SERVER__EC__EC_STORE=ec_identity_store
```

These `TRUSTED_SERVER__` overrides apply where deployment tooling merges environment values into the published configuration (for example test harnesses building an app-config blob). The running server reads its settings from the platform config store, so provider selection changes take effect when a new configuration is pushed, not per request.

### Field Details

#### `provider`

**Purpose**: Names the active Edge Cookie provider by its key. Omit to run statelessly with no Edge Cookie.

**Validation**: Application startup fails if the selected key has no matching `[ec.providers.<key>]` block, or is unknown.

#### `providers.hmac.passphrase`

**Purpose**: Publisher passphrase used as HMAC key for EC ID generation, read when `provider = "hmac"`.

**Security**:

- At least 32 characters
- Rotate periodically for security
- Store securely (environment variable recommended)

**Generation**:

```bash
# Generate secure random key
openssl rand -hex 32
```

**Validation**: Application startup fails if:

- Empty string
- Shorter than 32 characters

## Device Configuration

Selects how a request is classified into the coarse device signals the Edge Cookie bot gate uses, mirroring the Edge Cookie provider selection. These signals serve identifier gating and bot detection, not bid enrichment.

### `[device]`

| Field      | Type           | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `provider` | String or null | No       | Key of the device-detection provider. Defaults to `builtin` (User-Agent only, no host-specific call). Set `fastly` to add the host's TLS (JA4) and HTTP/2 probabilistic identifiers |

The default `builtin` provider classifies from the User-Agent alone and makes no host-specific call, so the default path stays host-neutral. Selecting an unknown provider key fails at startup.

**Example**:

```toml
[device]
provider = "builtin" # or "fastly" to add TLS and HTTP/2 evidence
```

**Environment Override**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__DEVICE__PROVIDER=builtin
```

## Geo Configuration

Selects how a client IP is resolved into geolocation (country, region, coordinates), mirroring the Edge Cookie provider selection. The resolved country also feeds the [permission model](/guide/permission-model).

### `[geo]`

| Field                        | Type           | Required        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `provider`                   | String or null | No              | Key of the geo provider. Omit to resolve no location and make no host geo call. Set `platform` to use the host's own geo lookup.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `default_country`            | String         | Yes             | Country (`US`) or country/region (`US/CA`) whose `permissions.yaml` rule applies when geo returns no country, or a country/region with no rule. Required, so there is always a default permission set and startup fails when unset. Validated at startup.                                                                      |
| `assume_single_jurisdiction` | Boolean        | See description | With no geo provider, every request is treated as `default_country`. A deployment that runs an Edge Cookie provider without a geo provider must set this to `true`, acknowledging single-jurisdiction operation; startup fails otherwise. Not needed when a geo provider is selected or no Edge Cookie provider is configured. |

No provider is the default, so a default deployment is not tied to any host geo service. Selecting an unknown provider key fails at startup. A failed geo lookup at request time does not fall back to `default_country`; it resolves every permission to the requires-signal floor and is logged at error level, so an outage is handled protectively.

**Example**:

```toml
[geo]
provider = "platform"
default_country = "US"
```

**Environment Override**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__GEO__PROVIDER=platform
```

## Provider Permissions

A provider advertises the technical permissions its data use requires, and Trusted Server runs the provider only when every required permission is set. This separates legal policy from the core, so the deployer brings the policy that decides how permissions are established. See the [Permission Model](/guide/permission-model) for the concept, the permission vocabulary, and how a request resolves.

### Country and region rules (`permissions.yaml`)

The country and region permission rules are defined in a human-editable `permissions.yaml` at the repository root, compiled into the build (not loaded at runtime). Edit that file and rebuild to change the policy. There is no `[permissions]` block in `trusted-server.toml`. It defines named **groups** (baselines such as `gdpr-eu`, `gdpr-uk`, `us-opt-out`) and **rules** that map a country or country/state to a group, with an optional `permissions` map that overrides single Data Uses (`granted`, `requires_signal`, or `denied`). A request that matches no rule uses the required `[geo] default_country` set in `trusted-server.toml`. See the [Permission Model](/guide/permission-model) for the schema and the shipped defaults.

## Response Headers

Custom headers added to all responses.

### `[response_headers]`

**Purpose**: Add custom HTTP headers to every response.

**Format**: Key-value pairs

**Example**:

```toml
[response_headers]
X-Custom-Header = "custom value"
X-Publisher-ID = "pub-12345"
X-Environment = "production"
Cache-Control = "public, max-age=3600"
```

**Environment Override**:

Use a JSON object to preserve header name casing and hyphens:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__RESPONSE_HEADERS='{"X-Robots-Tag": "noindex", "X-Custom-Header": "custom value"}'
```

::: tip Why JSON?
Individual env var keys like `TRUSTED_SERVER__RESPONSE_HEADERS__X_CUSTOM_HEADER` lose hyphens and casing (becoming `x_custom_header`). The JSON format preserves exact header names.
:::

**Use Cases**:

- Custom measurement headers
- Cache control overrides
- Debugging identifiers
- CORS headers (if needed)

::: warning Header Precedence
Custom headers may be overwritten by application logic. Standard headers (`Content-Type`, `Content-Length`) are controlled by the application.
:::

## Request Signing

Configuration for Ed25519 request signing and JWKS management.

### `[request_signing]`

| Field             | Type    | Required            | Description                             |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`         | Boolean | No (default: false) | Enable request signing features         |
| `config_store_id` | String  | If enabled          | Fastly Config Store ID for JWKS         |
| `secret_store_id` | String  | If enabled          | Fastly Secret Store ID for private keys |

**Example**:

```toml
[request_signing]
enabled = true
config_store_id = "01GXXX"  # From Fastly dashboard
secret_store_id = "01GYYY"  # From Fastly dashboard
```

**Environment Override**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__REQUEST_SIGNING__ENABLED=true
TRUSTED_SERVER__REQUEST_SIGNING__CONFIG_STORE_ID=01GXXX
TRUSTED_SERVER__REQUEST_SIGNING__SECRET_STORE_ID=01GYYY
```

### Store Setup

**Config Store** (for public keys):

```bash
# Create store
fastly config-store create --name=jwks_store

# Get store ID
fastly config-store list
```

**Secret Store** (for private keys):

```bash
# Create store
fastly secret-store create --name=signing_keys

# Get store ID
fastly secret-store list
```

**Local Dev Setup** (`fastly.toml`):

```toml
[local_server.config_stores]
  [local_server.config_stores.jwks_store]
    file = "test-data/jwks_store.json"

[local_server.secret_stores]
  [local_server.secret_stores.signing_keys]
    file = "test-data/signing_keys.json"
```

See [Request Signing](/guide/request-signing) and [Key Rotation](/guide/key-rotation) for usage.

## Basic Authentication Handlers

Path-based HTTP Basic Authentication.

### `[[handlers]]`

**Purpose**: Protect specific paths with username/password authentication.

**Format**: Array of handler objects

| Field      | Type           | Required | Description                       |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| `path`     | String (Regex) | Yes      | Regular expression matching paths |
| `username` | String         | Yes      | HTTP Basic Auth username          |
| `password` | String         | Yes      | HTTP Basic Auth password          |

**Example**:

```toml
# Single handler
[[handlers]]
path = "^/_ts/admin"
username = "admin"
password = "secure-password"

# Multiple handlers
[[handlers]]
path = "^/secure"
username = "user1"
password = "pass1"

[[handlers]]
path = "^/api/private"
username = "api-user"
password = "api-pass"
```

**Environment Override**:

```bash
# Handler 0
TRUSTED_SERVER__HANDLERS__0__PATH="^/_ts/admin"
TRUSTED_SERVER__HANDLERS__0__USERNAME="admin"
TRUSTED_SERVER__HANDLERS__0__PASSWORD="secure-password"

# Handler 1
TRUSTED_SERVER__HANDLERS__1__PATH="^/api/private"
TRUSTED_SERVER__HANDLERS__1__USERNAME="api-user"
TRUSTED_SERVER__HANDLERS__1__PASSWORD="api-pass"
```

### Path Patterns

**Regex Syntax**: Standard Rust regex patterns

**Examples**:

```toml
# Exact path
path = "^/_ts/admin$"  # Only /_ts/admin

# Prefix match
path = "^/_ts/admin"   # /_ts/admin, /_ts/admin/users, /_ts/admin/settings

# Multiple paths
path = "^/(admin|secure|private)"

# File extension
path = "\\.pdf$"   # All PDF files

# Complex pattern
path = "^/api/v[0-9]+/private"  # /api/v1/private, /api/v2/private
```

**Validation**: Application startup fails if regex is invalid.

::: warning Admin coverage and passwords are validated at startup

Startup fails when no handler covers an admin route. The dynamic
`/_ts/admin/ec/{id}` route accepts any segment after `/_ts/admin/ec/`, and
Basic Auth runs on the raw path before routing, so coverage cannot be inferred
from ID-shaped samples: a pattern such as
`^/_ts/admin/ec/[a-f0-9]{64}[.][A-Za-z0-9]{6}$` is rejected. Use a prefix-level
matcher (`^/_ts/admin`, or `^/_ts/admin/ec/` alongside the other admin
patterns).

Handler expressions match the raw URI path, while a publisher origin may decode
percent-encoded aliases before routing. For a whole-site staging gate, use
`path = "^/"`; do not rely on a decoded-path prefix such as `^/secure` to protect
equivalent origin paths.

Startup also fails when any handler — admin or not — uses a placeholder or
well-known weak password (`changeme`, `password`, `admin`, or a
`replace-with-…` template value). Handler selection is first-match-wins, so a
narrow handler ahead of the admin pattern governs the paths it matches.

:::

::: warning Scope patterns to the paths you mean

Handler patterns are matched against the full request path, so a broad pattern
covers everything beneath it. The `/_ts/` namespace holds both admin routes and
browser-facing endpoints that anonymous visitors must be able to reach:

| Path                     | Called by                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `/_ts/page-bids`         | Trusted Server JS, on SPA navigation |
| `/_ts/api/v1/identify`   | Trusted Server JS, in the browser    |
| `/_ts/api/v1/batch-sync` | Trusted Server JS, in the browser    |

A pattern such as `path = "^/_ts"` puts those behind Basic Auth. Browser
fetches never carry Basic credentials, so every visitor gets `401` — on
`/_ts/page-bids` that means no ads after any client-side navigation. Match the
admin routes specifically (`^/_ts/admin`) instead.

Upgrading from a release before `/_ts/page-bids` existed: if any handler
pattern covers it, narrow the pattern. The Trusted Server JS bundle falls back
to the deprecated `/__ts/page-bids` alias in the meantime, but that alias is
scheduled for removal
([#970](https://github.com/IABTechLab/trusted-server/issues/970)).

### Security Considerations

**Password Storage**:

- Stored in plain text in config
- Use environment variables in production
- Rotate passwords regularly
- Consider using Fastly Secret Store

**Limitations**:

- HTTP Basic Auth (not OAuth/JWT)
- Single username/password per path
- No role-based access control
- No rate limiting (add at edge)

::: warning Production Use
For production, store credentials in environment variables:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__HANDLERS__0__PASSWORD=$(cat /run/secrets/admin_password)
```

## URL Rewrite Configuration

Control which domains are excluded from first-party rewriting.

### `[rewrite]`

| Field             | Type          | Required         | Description               |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| `exclude_domains` | Array[String] | No (default: []) | Domains to skip rewriting |

**Example**:

```toml
[rewrite]
exclude_domains = [
    "*.cdn.trusted-partner.com",  # Wildcard
    "first-party.publisher.com",  # Exact match
    "localhost",                  # Development
]
```

**Environment Override**:

```bash
# JSON array
TRUSTED_SERVER__REWRITE__EXCLUDE_DOMAINS='["*.cdn.example.com","localhost"]'

# Indexed
TRUSTED_SERVER__REWRITE__EXCLUDE_DOMAINS__0="*.cdn.example.com"
TRUSTED_SERVER__REWRITE__EXCLUDE_DOMAINS__1="localhost"

# Comma-separated
TRUSTED_SERVER__REWRITE__EXCLUDE_DOMAINS="*.cdn.example.com,localhost"
```

### Pattern Matching

**Wildcard Patterns** (`*`):

```toml
"*.cdn.example.com"
```

Matches:

- ✅ `assets.cdn.example.com`
- ✅ `images.cdn.example.com`
- ✅ `cdn.example.com` (base domain)
- ❌ `cdn.example.com.evil.com` (different domain)

**Exact Patterns** (no `*`):

```toml
"api.example.com"
```

Matches:

- ✅ `api.example.com`
- ❌ `www.api.example.com`
- ❌ `api.example.com.evil.com`

### Use Cases

**Trusted Partners**:

```toml
exclude_domains = ["*.approved-cdn.com"]
```

**First-Party Resources**:

```toml
exclude_domains = ["assets.publisher.com", "static.publisher.com"]
```

**Development**:

```toml
exclude_domains = ["localhost", "127.0.0.1", "*.local"]
```

**Performance** (already first-party):

```toml
exclude_domains = ["*.publisher.com"]  # Skip unnecessary proxying
```

See [Creative Processing](/guide/creative-processing#exclude-domains) for details.

## Proxy Configuration

Controls first-party proxy security settings and path-based asset routes.

### `[proxy]`

| Field               | Type          | Required             | Description                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `allowed_domains`   | Array[String] | No (default: `[]`)   | Hosts permitted for signing, initial fetches, and redirects |
| `certificate_check` | Boolean       | No (default: `true`) | Verify TLS certificates when proxying HTTPS origins         |
| `asset_routes`      | Array[Table]  | No (default: `[]`)   | Path prefixes proxied directly to configured origins        |

**Example**:

```toml
[proxy]
allowed_domains = [
  "assets.example.com",  # Exact match
  "*.cdn.example.com",   # Wildcard: cdn.example.com and all subdomains
]
```

**Environment Override**:

```bash
# JSON array
TRUSTED_SERVER__PROXY__ALLOWED_DOMAINS='["assets.example.com","*.cdn.example.com"]'

# Indexed
TRUSTED_SERVER__PROXY__ALLOWED_DOMAINS__0="assets.example.com"
TRUSTED_SERVER__PROXY__ALLOWED_DOMAINS__1="*.cdn.example.com"

# Comma-separated
TRUSTED_SERVER__PROXY__ALLOWED_DOMAINS="assets.example.com,*.cdn.example.com"
```

### Field Details

#### `allowed_domains`

**Purpose**: Allowlist of target hosts permitted for `/first-party/sign` and `/first-party/proxy`. When `integrations.prebid.external_bundle_url` is configured, this list must cover its host and any HTTPS redirect targets.

**Behavior**: Trusted Server checks the parsed host before signing a target, before fetching the initial proxy target, and before following each HTTP redirect (301/302/303/307/308). A host that does not match the list is blocked with a 403 error.

**Default - open mode**: When `allowed_domains` is absent or empty and no external Prebid bundle is configured, every valid host is allowed for signing, initial fetches, and redirects. Configuring an external Prebid bundle with an empty list fails deploy validation. Open mode supports zero-config development but should not be used in production.

**Pattern Matching**:

| Pattern              | Matches                                                            | Does not match           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| `assets.example.com` | `assets.example.com`                                               | `sub.assets.example.com` |
| `*.cdn.example.com`  | `cdn.example.com`, `static.cdn.example.com`, `a.b.cdn.example.com` | `evil-cdn.example.com`   |

- `"example.com"` — exact match only.
- `"*.example.com"` — matches the base domain and any subdomain at any depth.
- Matching is case-insensitive; entries are normalized to lowercase at startup.
- Blank entries are ignored.
- The `*` wildcard requires a dot boundary: `*.example.com` does **not** match `evil-example.com`.

::: danger Production Recommendation
Always configure `allowed_domains` in production. Without an explicit allowlist, clients can sign and fetch valid URLs for arbitrary hosts, including redirect targets.

```toml
[proxy]
allowed_domains = [
  "assets.example.com",
  "*.cdn.example.com",
]
```

:::

See [First-Party Proxy](/guide/first-party-proxy#proxy-allowlist) for usage details.

#### `certificate_check`

**Purpose**: Control TLS certificate verification for HTTPS proxy and asset-route origins.

**Default**: `true`

Set this to `false` only for local development with self-signed certificates.

### `[[proxy.asset_routes]]`

Asset routes proxy selected first-party paths to an alternate asset origin without requiring signed `/first-party/proxy` URLs.

| Field             | Type   | Required | Description                                     |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `prefix`          | String | Yes      | Request path prefix to match                    |
| `origin_url`      | String | Yes      | Absolute `http` or `https` origin URL           |
| `path_pattern`    | String | No       | Regex matched against the incoming request path |
| `target_path`     | String | No       | Replacement path used with `path_pattern`       |
| `auth`            | Table  | No       | Optional origin authentication                  |
| `image_optimizer` | Table  | No       | Optional route-level Image Optimizer settings   |

**Example**:

```toml
[[proxy.asset_routes]]
prefix = "/assets/"
origin_url = "https://assets.example.com"
```

**Path rewrite example**:

```toml
[[proxy.asset_routes]]
prefix = "/.image/"
origin_url = "https://assets-cdn.example.com"
path_pattern = "^/\\.image/(.*)/[^/]+\\.([^/.]+)$"
target_path = "/image/upload/$1.$2"
```

**Behavior**:

- Only `GET` and `HEAD` requests use asset routes.
- Built-in and integration routes take precedence.
- The longest matching asset-route prefix wins.
- `path_pattern` and `target_path` must be configured together.
- `origin_url` must not include userinfo, a path, a query string, or a fragment.
- Unsafe origin response headers such as `Set-Cookie` are stripped before the response reaches the browser.

### `[proxy.asset_routes.auth]`

The first supported origin auth type is `s3_sigv4`.

| Field               | Type   | Required | Default             | Description                                     |
| ------------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `type`              | String | Yes      | none                | Must be `s3_sigv4`                              |
| `region`            | String | Yes      | none                | AWS region used in the SigV4 credential scope   |
| `secret_store`      | String | No       | `s3-auth`           | Runtime secret store containing AWS credentials |
| `access_key_id`     | String | No       | `access_key_id`     | Secret key containing the AWS access key ID     |
| `secret_access_key` | String | No       | `secret_access_key` | Secret key containing the AWS secret access key |
| `session_token`     | String | No       | unset               | Optional secret key containing a session token  |
| `origin_query`      | String | No       | route default       | `preserve` or `strip`                           |

**Example**:

```toml
[[proxy.asset_routes]]
prefix = "/.image/"
origin_url = "https://bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"

[proxy.asset_routes.auth]
type = "s3_sigv4"
region = "us-east-1"
origin_query = "strip"
secret_store = "s3-auth"
access_key_id = "access_key_id"
secret_access_key = "secret_access_key"
# session_token = "session_token"
```

S3 auth uses header-based AWS SigV4 with `UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD`. It is scoped to read-only asset requests and expects `origin_url` to use the S3 host that AWS validates. Credentials are cached per process by configured secret names after the first successful read.

Effective `origin_query` precedence is auth-level `origin_query`, then enabled Image Optimizer `origin_query`, then the route default.

### `[proxy.asset_routes.image_optimizer]`

Route-level Image Optimizer configuration selects a reusable profile set.

| Field          | Type    | Required         | Default              | Description                                                                 |
| -------------- | ------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`      | Boolean | No               | `true`               | Enable Image Optimizer for the route                                        |
| `region`       | String  | Yes when enabled | none                 | Fastly IO processing region, such as `us_east`                              |
| `profile_set`  | String  | Yes when enabled | none                 | Name under `[image_optimizer.profile_sets.*]`                               |
| `origin_query` | String  | No               | `strip` when enabled | `preserve` or `strip`; effective `preserve` is rejected while IO is enabled |

**Example**:

```toml
[proxy.asset_routes.image_optimizer]
enabled = true
region = "us_east"
profile_set = "default_images"
```

### `[image_optimizer.profile_sets.<name>]`

Profile sets convert small request query controls into a closed set of Image Optimizer parameters.

| Field                | Type   | Required | Default       | Description                                      |
| -------------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `base_params`        | String | No       | `""`          | Params applied before profile-specific params    |
| `default_profile`    | String | No       | `default`     | Profile used when no profile is requested        |
| `unknown_profile`    | String | No       | `use_default` | `use_default` or `reject`                        |
| `profile_param`      | String | No       | `profile`     | Query parameter containing the profile name      |
| `aspect_ratio_param` | String | No       | `ar`          | Query parameter containing aspect ratio          |
| `debug_param`        | String | No       | `_io_debug`   | Query parameter that disables IO when set to `1` |

Profile values live under `[image_optimizer.profile_sets.<name>.profiles]` and use query-string syntax.

```toml
[image_optimizer.profile_sets.default_images]
base_params = "quality=70&resize-filter=bicubic"
default_profile = "default"
unknown_profile = "use_default"
profile_param = "profile"
aspect_ratio_param = "ar"
debug_param = "_io_debug"

[image_optimizer.profile_sets.default_images.profiles]
default = "width=1920"
medium = "format=auto&width=828"
thumbnail = "width=150&crop=1:1,smart"
```

Supported profile parameters are `quality`, `resize-filter`, `format`, `width`, `height`, and `crop`. Unknown profile parameters fail configuration validation.

## Cache Configuration

Static and rehosted asset cache upgrades are operator-controlled. By default,
Trusted Server leaves arbitrary publisher-origin assets under origin cache
control. Add `[[cache.asset_rules]]` entries only for paths that are known to be
content-addressed or otherwise safe for the configured TTL.

### `[[cache.asset_rules]]`

Rules are evaluated in file order; the first enabled matching rule wins.
Disabled rules never match, and their matcher and policy validation is deferred
until they are enabled. Rule IDs are always normalized and must remain nonempty
and unique, including for disabled placeholders.

| Field                            | Type          | Required | Description                                                                        |

An enabled rule must configure exactly one matcher. Public rules must configure
at least one of `browser_ttl_seconds` or `edge_ttl_seconds`; private rules must
configure `browser_ttl_seconds` and must not configure `edge_ttl_seconds`.
`path_glob` and `path_globs` are mutually exclusive. `immutable = true`
additionally requires a positive browser TTL and either the content-addressed
`nextjs-static` preset, `hex`, or `esbuild-base32`.

The filename fingerprint check examines the suffix immediately before the final
extension and requires a nonempty filename prefix separated by `.`, `-`, `_`,
or `~`. The accepted immutable conventions are:

- `hex`: hexadecimal suffixes of at least eight characters containing a letter,
  such as `app.0123abcd.js`;
- `esbuild-base32`: eight-character uppercase Base32 suffixes, such as
  `app-VRTVD5R5.js`.

`vite-base64-url` remains available for non-immutable cache rules, but it cannot
prove content addressing. Ordinary names such as `hero-Portrait.jpg` can match
its eight-character Base64URL shape. A matching rule whose selected fingerprint
style fails emits a debug log with the rule ID and rejected path.

Glob patterns are case-sensitive. `*` matches within a single path component,
while `**` matches recursively: `/assets/*.js` matches `/assets/app.js` but not
`/assets/vendor/app.js`; `/assets/**/*.js` matches both.

**Next.js preset example** (disabled until the publisher confirms
`/_next/static/` is content-addressed):

```toml
[[cache.asset_rules]]
id = "nextjs-static"
enabled = false
preset = "nextjs-static"
visibility = "public"
browser_ttl_seconds = 31536000
edge_ttl_seconds = 31536000
immutable = true
```

**Publisher allowlist example** (enable only for an unambiguous immutable
filename convention):

```toml
[[cache.asset_rules]]
id = "publisher-fingerprinted-assets"
enabled = false
path_globs = [
  "/assets/**/*.js",
  "/assets/**/*.css",
  "/assets/**/*.png",
  "/assets/**/*.webp",
]
fingerprint_style = "hex"
visibility = "public"
browser_ttl_seconds = 31536000
edge_ttl_seconds = 31536000
immutable = true
```

If `[cache]` is omitted or no enabled rule matches, Trusted Server preserves the
origin cache policy for publisher-origin assets. On the publisher pass-through
path, an origin `private` or `no-store` directive vetoes a matching rule. Other
origin cache directives, including `no-cache`, are replaced by the configured
policy. `Vary` is preserved, so do not assign a public immutable rule to paths
that vary by cookies or other user-specific request state.

On a configured Fastly asset-rehost route, a matching rule is authoritative
over the third-party origin's cache defaults, including `no-store`, because
Trusted Server owns the rehosted copy. A later Trusted Server or operator-applied
`private` or `no-store` directive still vetoes public policy reapplication and
removes shared-cache headers.

TS-owned validated hash URLs such as `/static/tsjs=...js?v=<hash>` use their
built-in cache policy and do not require an asset rule. Shared-cache keys for
`/static/tsjs=` must preserve `v`; otherwise a matching immutable response can
collide with the missing or mismatched version's short-TTL response.

`edge_ttl_seconds` only emits the selected runtime's shared-cache directive for
public rules. The runtime or service must also enable and consume that
directive. The checked-in Cloudflare manifests intentionally do not enable
Workers Cache: the Worker serves the full publisher gateway, not an isolated
static-only entrypoint. Emitting `Cloudflare-CDN-Cache-Control` alone must not
be treated as permission to cache every response. Any future Workers Cache
opt-in must isolate or explicitly allowlist cacheable traffic. Fastly synthetic
and final egress responses still require explicit runtime cache integration,
tracked in [#908](https://github.com/IABTechLab/trusted-server/issues/908).

APS is configured exclusively under `[integrations.aps]`. `aps` entries in
`bidders` or `client_side_bidders` are logged and removed case-insensitively so
an upgrade does not prevent Trusted Server from starting. Remove those entries
from operator configuration; this guard prevents APS demand from reaching
Prebid Server or the client-side Prebid bundle.

**Example**:

```toml
[integrations.prebid]
enabled = true
server_url = "https://prebid-server.example/openrtb2/auction"
timeout_ms = 1200
bidders = ["kargo", "appnexus", "openx"]
debug = false
# test_mode = false

# Bidders that run client-side via native Prebid.js adapters
client_side_bidders = ["rubicon"]

# Customize script interception (optional)
script_patterns = ["/prebid.js", "/prebid.min.js"]

[integrations.prebid.bid_param_overrides.criteo]
networkId = 99999
pubid = "server-pub"

[integrations.prebid.bid_param_zone_overrides.kargo]
header = { placementId = "_s2sHeaderPlacement" }

[[integrations.prebid.bid_param_override_rules]]
when.bidder = "kargo"
when.zone = "header"
set = { placementId = "_s2sHeaderPlacement" }
```

**Environment Override**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__PREBID__ENABLED=true
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__PREBID__SERVER_URL=https://prebid.example/auction
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__PREBID__TIMEOUT_MS=1200
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__PREBID__BIDDERS=kargo,appnexus,openx
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__PREBID__BID_PARAM_OVERRIDES='{"criteo":{"networkId":99999,"pubid":"server-pub"}}'
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__PREBID__BID_PARAM_ZONE_OVERRIDES='{"kargo":{"header":{"placementId":"_s2sHeaderPlacement"}}}'
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__PREBID__BID_PARAM_OVERRIDE_RULES='[{"when":{"bidder":"kargo","zone":"header"},"set":{"placementId":"_s2sHeaderPlacement"}}]'
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__PREBID__CLIENT_SIDE_BIDDERS=rubicon

TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__PREBID__DEBUG_QUERY_PARAMS=debug=1
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__PREBID__SCRIPT_PATTERNS='["/prebid.js","/prebid.min.js"]'
```

**Script Pattern Matching**:

The `script_patterns` configuration determines which Prebid scripts are intercepted and replaced with empty JavaScript responses. This prevents client-side Prebid.js from loading when using server-side bidding.

- **Suffix matching**: `/prebid.min.js` matches any URL ending with that path
- **Wildcard patterns**: `/static/prebid/*` matches paths under that prefix
- **Disable interception**: Set `script_patterns = []` to keep client-side Prebid

See [Prebid Integration](/guide/integrations/prebid) for full details.

**Bid Param Override Surfaces**:

- `bid_param_overrides`: Static per-bidder shallow-merge overrides.
- `bid_param_zone_overrides`: Per-bidder, per-zone shallow-merge overrides.
- `bid_param_override_rules`: Canonical ordered rules with `when` matchers and `set` objects.

Compatibility fields are normalized into the same runtime engine as canonical rules. Explicit `bid_param_override_rules` run after compatibility-derived rules, so later canonical rules win on conflicts.

### Next.js Integration

**Section**: `[integrations.nextjs]`

| Field                        | Type          | Default                 | Description                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `enabled`                    | Boolean       | `false`                 | Enable Next.js integration    |
| `rewrite_attributes`         | Array[String] | `["href","link","url"]` | Attributes to rewrite         |
| `max_combined_payload_bytes` | Integer       | `10485760`              | Max combined RSC payload size |

**Example**:

```toml
[integrations.nextjs]
enabled = true
rewrite_attributes = ["href", "link", "url", "src"]
max_combined_payload_bytes = 10485760
```

**Environment Override**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__NEXTJS__ENABLED=true
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__NEXTJS__REWRITE_ATTRIBUTES=href,link,url,src
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__NEXTJS__MAX_COMBINED_PAYLOAD_BYTES=10485760
```

### Osano Integration

**Section**: `[integrations.osano]`

| Field     | Type    | Default | Description                             |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `enabled` | Boolean | `false` | Enable the Osano browser consent mirror |

**Example**:

```toml
[integrations.osano]
enabled = true
```

**Environment Override**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__OSANO__ENABLED=true
```

The Osano mirror runs in the browser, so consent cookies it writes are available to Trusted Server on requests after the page where Osano consent APIs become ready. See [Osano Integration](/guide/integrations/osano) for details.

### Permutive Integration

## Auction Configuration

Settings for the auction orchestrator that coordinates multiple bid providers.

### `[auction]`

| Field                | Type          | Default            | Description                                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`            | Boolean       | `false`            | Enable the auction orchestrator                                |
| `sanitize_creatives` | Boolean       | `false`            | Strip executable markup from winning-bid `adm` before delivery |
| `rewrite_creatives`  | Boolean       | `true`             | Rewrite winning-bid `adm` through first-party endpoints        |
| `providers`          | Array[String] | `[]`               | Provider names that participate (e.g., `["prebid", "aps"]`)    |
| `mediator`           | String        | Optional           | Mediator provider name (runs parallel mediation when set)      |
| `timeout_ms`         | Integer       | `2000`             | Auction timeout in milliseconds                                |
| `creative_store`     | String        | `"creative_store"` | Deprecated; creatives are now delivered inline                 |

Creative markup delivered by `POST /auction` and the publisher SSAT/page-bids
path is processed by two independent passes. With `sanitize_creatives = true`
(opt-in, default `false`), executable markup (`script`/`object`/`embed`/`form`
and event handlers) is stripped together with its inner content — note this
blanks script-based creatives, so enable it only when creatives render in a
context that shares the publisher's origin. With `rewrite_creatives = true`
(the default), eligible absolute or protocol-relative resource and click URLs
not excluded by rewrite configuration are converted to signed first-party
endpoints, and any bidder-supplied `<base>` element is removed. The
`POST /auction` path emits root-relative endpoints and injects the creative TSJS
runtime exactly once — whether or not the bidder supplied a `<body>`, since bare
fragments are the common `adm` shape; the foreign-origin SSAT renderer emits
absolute endpoints and does not inject that bundle. With both disabled, `adm` ships
exactly as the bidder returned it — except that a creative larger than the
1 MiB per-creative cap is rejected in every mode and its `adm` is dropped.
Accepted external URLs are not host allowlisted by the sanitizer. Neither
setting affects HTML or CSS fetched through `/first-party/proxy`. See
[Creative Processing](/guide/creative-processing#auction-rewrite-control).

::: warning Existing configs, upgrade sequencing, and rollback
Default values are omitted from stored JSON; non-default values
(`sanitize_creatives = true`, `rewrite_creatives = false`) are serialized, and
older `AuctionConfig` schemas reject unknown fields.

**Upgrading:** binaries that predate `sanitize_creatives` reject a blob that
carries it, so in a rolling deployment upgrade the binary **first**, then push
a config with `sanitize_creatives = true` if you want sanitization. Between the
binary upgrade and the config push, sanitization is off (the new default) —
during that interval the creative iframe sandbox is the only isolation for
`/auction` markup. There is no mixed-version-safe value that keeps the old
unconditional sanitization: omission means "sanitize" on old code and "don't"
on new code, while an explicit `true` fails startup on old code.

**Rolling back:** before reverting to a binary that does not know a field,
remove that field's non-default value (and any environment override), run
`ts config validate`, push the resulting default-compatible blob, and only then
roll back the binary.

**Environment overlays:** EdgeZero's env overlays cannot create missing TOML
leaves. Existing configs must add **both** leaves under `[auction]`
(`rewrite_creatives` and `sanitize_creatives`) before
`TRUSTED_SERVER__AUCTION__REWRITE_CREATIVES` /
`TRUSTED_SERVER__AUCTION__SANITIZE_CREATIVES` can take effect — an override for
a missing leaf is silently ignored.

## Creative Opportunities Configuration

### `[creative_opportunities]`

Defines the ad slots the trusted server offers on a page: which pages each slot
appears on (`page_patterns`), its supported sizes (`formats`), and the GAM ad
unit it maps to (`gam_unit_path`).

`enabled` is the dedicated server-side ad-template switch. It defaults to `true`
for compatibility with existing configurations. Set it to `false` to stop
publisher HTML and SPA page-bids template delivery while retaining the slot
configuration and direct `POST /auction` endpoint.

#### Publisher document cache policy

For a successful GET publisher document, Trusted Server applies the
browser-only `Cache-Control: private, max-age=60` policy from
[#1007](https://github.com/IABTechLab/trusted-server/issues/1007) when the
server-side ad stack is structurally inactive. Trusted Server also applies this
policy to a subsequent `304 Not Modified` response so revalidation cannot
restore the origin freshness policy. This includes an absent
`[creative_opportunities]` section, `enabled = false`, no slot matching the
path, or a disabled auction. The `private` directive prevents shared caches
that use `Cache-Control` from storing the document. The policy replaces the
origin browser cache policy except when the origin sends `private` or
`no-store`, which are preserved. Bot, prefetch, and consent-denied requests
also retain the origin policy because they can produce a request-specific
representation for the same URL. Error responses and non-document requests
retain the origin policy.

Trusted Server leaves origin validators and CDN-specific cache headers
unchanged. Those headers continue to control supporting CDNs independently of
the browser-only policy. If a response using the generated inactive-stack
policy later carries `Set-Cookie`, cookie privacy finalization replaces it with
`Cache-Control: private, max-age=0` and removes the CDN-specific cache headers.

```toml
[creative_opportunities]
enabled = true # set to false to disable server-side ad templates
gam_network_id = "123456789"
price_granularity = "dense"

# Shared placeholder value for the site root ("/") — see {section} below.
section_root = "home"
# Which path segment names the section, 0-based. Default 0 (first segment).
# Set to 1 for locale-prefixed URLs such as "/en/news/article".
# section_segment = 0

[[creative_opportunities.slot]]
id = "ad-header"
gam_unit_path = "/{network_id}/example/{section}"
# List each section landing page as well as its subtree: `/news/*` matches
# `/news/article` but NOT `/news` — the glob requires the trailing separator.
page_patterns = ["/", "/news", "/news/*", "/reviews", "/reviews/*"]
formats = [{ width = 728, height = 90 }]
```

The same switch can be overridden through the typed CLI environment overlay.
Because EdgeZero only replaces TOML leaves that already exist, first add
`enabled = true` to the `[creative_opportunities]` block in the base config
before using this override. See [Environment Variable Overrides (Typed
CLI)](#environment-variable-overrides-typed-cli) for the general overlay rules.

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__CREATIVE_OPPORTUNITIES__ENABLED=false
```

> [!WARNING]
> Setting `enabled = false` writes this field into the pushed configuration blob.
> Binaries released before this setting reject the unknown field and fail to load
> settings, which makes every request fail. Before rolling back to an older binary,
> restore `enabled` to its default, re-push and finalize the configuration, then
> roll back the binary.

### Shared template assembly (`assembly_mode = "esi"`)

This configuration is an experimental validation spike scoped to
[IABTechLab/trusted-server#1009](https://github.com/IABTechLab/trusted-server/issues/1009),
not a settled production cache interface.

`assembly_mode` controls how initial-page slot and bid state is delivered:

- `inline` (default) transforms every origin response and injects the current
  reader's slots and bids directly.
- `esi` opts into a reader-neutral transformed-template cache on Fastly. The
  cache stores identity bytes containing one inert, versioned comment. On an
  authorized cold miss, Fastly replaces that comment in a private working copy
  with one synthetic ESI include and resolves it from the already-built reader
  state using the pinned `stackpop/esi` parser. No HTTP fragment request occurs.
  Warm hits use an exact byte split instead, preserving the fast article-prefix
  stream while the auction finishes.

This is deliberately not general publisher-controlled ESI. A transformed origin
document containing any `<esi:` directive bypasses the template cache and the parser, while the
ordinary byte seam still produces the reader's complete response. The stored shared template
object never contains executable ESI markup.

Only Fastly currently supplies the Core Cache backend used by the shared template cache. Other adapters accept
the mode but safely fall back to the inline transform on every request. This is
not a top-level HTTP cache hit: Compute still runs and the final assembled
response is always `Cache-Control: private, no-store`.

All four keys below belong directly under `[creative_opportunities]`. They are
one feature contract: `assembly_mode` selects how creative-opportunity state is
delivered, while the other three constrain when and how long that mode may share
its template.
They are not a general top-level HTTP-cache configuration.

```toml
[creative_opportunities]
assembly_mode = "esi"

# Every request header, except Accept-Encoding, that the publisher origin can
# name in Vary for these documents. Names are validated and de-duplicated.
template_cache_vary = [
  "rsc",
  "next-router-state-tree",
  "next-router-prefetch",
  "next-router-segment-prefetch",
]

# Safety ceiling for the shared template. Defaults to 60; valid range 1–86400.
# The origin's remaining edge freshness may make the actual lifetime shorter.
template_cache_max_age_seconds = 1200

# Default false. Enable only after proving publisher HTML ignores Cookie.
origin_is_cookie_independent = true
```

The cache fails closed. A template is stored only for a `GET` with a processable
`200 text/html` origin response, a supported content encoding, and explicit
positive shared freshness. `private`, `no-store`, `no-cache`, exhausted or
malformed freshness, `Set-Cookie`, `Vary: *`, `Vary: Cookie`, uncovered `Vary`
names, response-bound CSP nonces, pass-through or ambiguous authorization,
diagnostics sessions, range or conditional requests, positive or malformed
request `max-age`, `min-fresh`, and unsupported CDN-specific cache policy fields
all bypass the template cache. Fastly
`Surrogate-Control` is the narrow exception: the template cache accepts exactly one positive
`max-age` plus optional valid `stale-while-revalidate` and `stale-if-error`
delta-seconds. Restrictive, duplicated, malformed, or unknown directives fail
closed. Stale windows never extend template-cache freshness. Freshness follows Fastly edge
precedence: `Surrogate-Control: max-age`, then `Cache-Control: s-maxage`,
`Cache-Control: max-age`, then `Expires`. Restrictive directives in either policy
still refuse sharing. Origin `Age` and apparent age from `Date` are deducted, time
spent transforming the page continues consuming freshness, and the remaining
lifetime is capped by `template_cache_max_age_seconds`.

A browser reload commonly sends `Cache-Control: max-age=0`. TS may reuse a fresh
reader-neutral shared template for that reload, but it still builds a new private
response and runs a new per-reader auction. Explicit `no-cache`, `no-store`,
positive or malformed request `max-age`, range, and conditional requests still bypass the template cache.
Check `X-TS-Template-Cache: hit` to verify template reuse.

Authorization has one narrow exception. A request carrying exactly the same
single Basic credential that Trusted Server just validated at the edge may share
a template; pass-through, repeated, appended, or replaced values still bypass.
Trusted Server does not remove the validated header, so it remains forwarded to
the publisher origin. If the origin uses that credential to select response
content, it must declare `Vary: Authorization`; that response is deliberately not
stored as a shared template.

`template_cache_vary` is necessary because lookup occurs before the origin can
return `Vary`. Presence, empty values, repeated raw field values, host/scheme,
origin identity, complete template-shaping settings, TSJS content, and schema
version all participate in an opaque SHA-256 cache key. `Accept-Encoding` does
not: the stored template is decoded identity and the assembled result is encoded
for each reader with `Vary: Accept-Encoding`. This assumes the origin's
`Accept-Encoding` variants differ only by HTTP content coding, as normal
compression negotiation does. Do not enable ESI for an origin that changes the
document's meaning based on `Accept-Encoding`. Never put `Cookie` or
`Authorization` in `template_cache_vary`; startup rejects both because raw cookie
or credential values are not reader-neutral template dimensions. With
`origin_is_cookie_independent = false` (the safe default), all cookie-bearing
requests bypass. With it set to `true`, an origin `Vary: Cookie` still overrides
the assertion and refuses storage. Every other name the origin emits in `Vary`
must appear in the configured list; an uncovered name safely refuses template
storage.

For a canary, inspect `X-TS-Template-Cache`. Its bounded values are `hit`,
`miss-stored`, `miss-store-error`, `miss-reserved`, `bypass-request`,
`bypass-response`, `unsupported`, `invalid`, and `backend-error`. No URL, header
value, or cache key is exposed. `invalid` and `backend-error` fail open to a
fresh origin response; they do not fail the page. The corresponding
`template_cache` logs provide server-side observability for this path.

`X-TS-Assembly` identifies how the private response was assembled:

- `esi-parser` — authorized cold miss assembled by the repaired parser;
- `byte-seam` — warm template-cache hit using the streaming byte seam;
- `byte-seam-fallback` — cold response safely assembled by byte seam because
  the platform parser was unavailable or rejected the document.

The two headers together are the reliable verification signal. Timing alone can
vary with the origin, auction, compression, browser connection reuse, and local
proxy buffering.

Rollback must preserve configuration compatibility:

1. Change `assembly_mode` to `inline` and deploy/push that configuration.
2. Before rolling back to a binary that predates these fields, remove
   `assembly_mode`, `template_cache_vary`, `template_cache_max_age_seconds`, and
   `origin_is_cookie_independent`, then push the cleaned configuration. Older binaries
   use `deny_unknown_fields` and intentionally reject unknown keys.
3. Purge the Fastly surrogate key `ts-template` using the service's normal purge
   tooling, or wait for the bounded origin-derived lifetime to expire.

Run `scripts/template-cache-local-test.sh esi` before a rollout and
`scripts/template-cache-local-test.sh inline` as its control. The harness uses a temporary
manifest, never edits the tracked `fastly.toml`, verifies cold/warm origin
counts and response integrity, and executes the generated GPT module against
the served seam to require a real `defineSlot` call.

### `gam_unit_path` templating

`gam_unit_path` is a template. A publisher whose ad unit varies by site section
expresses that in **one** slot rule instead of one rule per (slot × section).

Supported placeholders:

| Placeholder    | Resolves to                                                             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{network_id}` | `gam_network_id`                                                        |
| `{slot_id}`    | the slot's `id`                                                         |
| `{section}`    | non-empty path segment at `section_segment` (default: first; see below) |

A template with **no** placeholders is used verbatim. A slot with **no**
`gam_unit_path` falls back to `/<network_id>/<slot_id>`. Both preserve the
pre-templating behavior, so existing static configs are unchanged.

Trusted Server conservatively caps the whole rendered dynamic path at 100 UTF-8
bytes, informed by Google's [100-character per-ad-unit-code
limit](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/1628457?hl=en). If a
request-specific substitution would exceed the dynamic limit, only that slot is
omitted before auction dispatch; the response itself still succeeds. Trusted
Server logs a warning containing the slot ID and request path. Explicit static
paths and absent/default paths retain legacy behavior and are not subject to this
dynamic-only limit.

### `{section}` derivation

`{section}` is derived from the request path at request time:

- It is the non-empty path segment at `section_segment` (0-based, default `0`).
  With the default, `/news/article-123` → `news`. A site that prefixes a locale
  sets `section_segment = 1`, so `/en/news/article` → `news` rather than `en`.
- It is sanitized: each run of characters outside `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` becomes a
  single `_`, and the request-derived result is capped at 100 ASCII bytes.
- Casing is preserved. [Google documents GAM ad-unit codes as
  case-insensitive](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/10477476?hl=en),
  so do not lowercase the value.
- The path is used **raw — it is not percent-decoded**. So `/new%20s` →
  `new_20s` (only `%` is disallowed; `2` and `0` are kept), never the decoded
  `new_s`. This keeps `{section}` consistent with how `page_patterns` match the
  same raw path.
- When the path has no segment at that index — the site root (`/`, or repeated
  slashes), or a path shorter than `section_segment` — `{section}` is
  `section_root`. So with `section_segment = 1`, the path `/en` renders the root
  section rather than reusing the locale.

`section_root` is **required** whenever any slot's template uses `{section}`,
and must match `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`. There is no default: the home-section name is
publisher-specific. Startup fails if `{section}` is used without a valid
`section_root`. Startup rejects a blank `gam_network_id` only when an absent
path/default or a `{network_id}` template consumes it; static paths and
templates without `{network_id}` do not consume it. A
`[creative_opportunities]` block with `enabled = false` or no slots is
inactive, so no publisher templates are delivered and its `gam_network_id` is
not checked when no slot uses it.

Both knobs are config-driven, so the URL→section convention stays with the
publisher: `section_segment` selects which segment names the section, and
`section_root` names the section when there is none.

During typed/startup finalization, after templates parse successfully, every
placeholder-bearing dynamic template that omits `section_segment` has
`section_segment = 0` materialized, so an older binary rejects the pushed blob
loudly. Static and absent paths remain compatible with the legacy config schema
only when both `section_root` and `section_segment` are omitted. Before rolling
back below this feature, replace or remove dynamic paths, remove both
`section_root` and `section_segment`, re-push and finalize the config, then
roll back the binary.

Example resolution for `gam_unit_path = "/{network_id}/example/{section}"` with
`gam_network_id = "123456789"`, `section_root = "home"`, and the
`page_patterns` shown above:

| Request path    | `gam_unit_path`              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `/`             | `/123456789/example/home`    |
| `/news`         | `/123456789/example/news`    |
| `/news/article` | `/123456789/example/news`    |
| `/reviews/x`    | `/123456789/example/reviews` |

The same config with `section_segment = 1` and locale-prefixed patterns
(`["/en", "/en/news", "/en/news/*"]`):

| Request path       | `gam_unit_path`           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `/en`              | `/123456789/example/home` |
| `/en/news`         | `/123456789/example/news` |
| `/en/news/article` | `/123456789/example/news` |

An **unmatched route** — a path matched by no slot's `page_patterns` — produces
no slot at all, so no template is rendered for it.

Startup validation rejects a malformed template: an unknown placeholder (e.g.
`{oops}`), an unmatched or nested `{`, a stray `}`, or an empty `gam_unit_path`.

## Fastly Runtime Config Store

After the EdgeZero cutover, the Fastly adapter always dispatches through the
EdgeZero entry point. The former `edgezero_enabled` and `edgezero_rollout_pct`
canary keys are no longer read.

The Fastly service must still provide a `trusted_server_config` config store
because the entry point opens it before dispatch and passes the handle to
EdgeZero-backed platform services. The store may be empty unless another feature
adds keys to it.

**Local development** (`fastly.toml`):

```toml
[local_server.config_stores]
  [local_server.config_stores.trusted_server_config]
    format = "inline-toml"
    [local_server.config_stores.trusted_server_config.contents]
```

**Production setup** (Fastly CLI):

```bash
# Create the store once and attach it to the service.
fastly config-store create --name trusted_server_config
```

Rollback to the legacy entry point is no longer controlled by runtime config
keys. Use the normal deployment rollback path to restore a pre-cleanup service
version if that is required.

## Validation

### Automatic Validation

Configuration is validated at startup:

**Publisher Validation**:

- All fields non-empty
- `origin_url` is valid URL

**EC Validation**:

- `provider`, when set, names a provider with a matching `[ec.providers.<key>]` block; an unknown or unconfigured selection fails at startup
- `providers.hmac.passphrase` ≥ 32 characters
- `providers.hmac.passphrase` ≠ known placeholders (`"secret-key"`, `"secret_key"`, `"trusted-server"`, case-insensitive)

**Handler Validation**:

- `path` is valid regex
- `username` non-empty
- `password` non-empty

**Integration Validation**:

- Each integration implements `Validate` trait
- Custom rules per integration

### Validation Errors

**Startup Failure** if:

- Required fields missing
- Invalid data types
- Regex compilation fails
- Secret key is default value
- Integration config fails validation

**Error Format**:

```
Configuration error: Integration 'prebid' configuration failed validation:
server_url: must not be empty
```

## Best Practices

### Configuration Management

**Development**:

```toml
# trusted-server.dev.toml
[publisher]
domain = "localhost"
origin_url = "http://localhost:3000"
proxy_secret = "dev-secret"
```

**Staging**:

```bash
# .env.staging
TRUSTED_SERVER__PUBLISHER__ORIGIN_URL=https://staging.publisher.com
TRUSTED_SERVER__PUBLISHER__PROXY_SECRET=$(cat /run/secrets/proxy_secret_staging)
```

**Production**:

```bash
# All secrets from environment
TRUSTED_SERVER__PUBLISHER__PROXY_SECRET=$(cat /run/secrets/proxy_secret)
TRUSTED_SERVER__EC__PROVIDERS__HMAC__PASSPHRASE=$(cat /run/secrets/ec_secret)
TRUSTED_SERVER__HANDLERS__0__PASSWORD=$(cat /run/secrets/admin_password)
```

### Secret Management

**Do**:
✅ Use environment variables for secrets  
✅ Rotate secrets periodically  
✅ Generate cryptographically random values  
✅ Store in secure secret management (Fastly Secret Store, Vault)  
✅ Use different secrets per environment

**Don't**:
❌ Commit secrets to version control  
❌ Use default/placeholder values  
❌ Share secrets across environments  
❌ Log secret values  
❌ Expose in error messages

### File Organization

**Recommended Structure**:

```
trusted-server.toml          # Base config
trusted-server.dev.toml      # Development overrides
.env.development             # Dev environment vars
.env.staging                 # Staging environment vars
.env.production              # Production environment vars (not in git)
.env.example                 # Example template (in git)
```

**.gitignore**:

```
.env.production
.env.staging
.env.local
*.secret
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to build configuration"**:

- Check TOML syntax (trailing commas, quotes)
- Verify all required fields present
- Check environment variable format

**"Configuration field '...' is set to a known placeholder value"**:

- `ec.providers.hmac.passphrase` cannot be `"secret-key"`, `"secret_key"`, or `"trusted-server"` (case-insensitive)
- `publisher.proxy_secret` cannot be `"change-me-proxy-secret"` (case-insensitive)
- Must be non-empty
- Change to a secure random value (see generation commands above)

**"Invalid regex"**:

- Handler `path` must be valid regex
- Test pattern: `echo "^/_ts/admin" | grep -E "^/_ts/admin"`
- Escape special characters: `\.`, `\$`, etc.

**"Integration configuration could not be parsed"**:

- Check JSON syntax in env vars
- Verify indexed arrays (0, 1, 2...)
- Check field names match exactly

**Environment Variables Not Applied**:

- Run the override through `ts config validate`, `ts config diff`, or `ts config push`
- Verify the target leaf already exists in `trusted-server.toml`; the env overlay does not create missing fields
- Verify prefix: `TRUSTED_SERVER__`
- Check separator: `__` (double underscore)
- Confirm the variable is exported: `echo $VARIABLE_NAME`
- Rerun `ts config push` after changing a deploy-time override
- Try explicit string: `VARIABLE='value'` not `VARIABLE=value`

### Debug Configuration

**Print Loaded Config** (test only):

```rust
use trusted_server_core::settings_data::get_settings;

let settings = get_settings()?;
println!("{:#?}", settings);
```

**Check Environment**:

```bash
# List all TRUSTED_SERVER variables
env | grep TRUSTED_SERVER
```

**Validate TOML**:

```bash
# Use any TOML validator
cat trusted-server.toml | npx toml-cli validate
```
