# Configuration

Learn how to configure Trusted Server for your deployment.

## Overview

Trusted Server uses a flexible configuration system based on:

1. **TOML Files** - `trusted-server.toml` for ordinary configuration and secret key names
2. **Environment Variables** - Typed CLI overrides with the `TRUSTED_SERVER__` prefix
3. **EdgeZero Stores** - Config and secret stores for the pushed blob and runtime secret values

Everything the deployment can switch on is a provider, and every provider type
is written the same way. Read
[Configuration Rules](/guide/configuration-rules) first. It is short, and it
is the pattern every section below follows:

```toml
[<type>]
provider = "<name>"            # or a list, where several run

[<type>.<name>]                # only when the provider has settings
setting = "value"
```

## Quick Start

### Minimal Configuration

Create `trusted-server.toml` in your project root. Generate both secret values
first with `openssl rand -base64 32`. The placeholders below are intentionally
rejected until replaced.

```toml
[publisher]
domain = "publisher.com"
cookie_domain = ".publisher.com"
origin_url = "https://origin.publisher.com"
proxy_secret = "publisher_proxy_secret"

[ec]
provider = "hmac"

[ec.hmac]
passphrase = "ec_passphrase"
```

### Environment Variable Overrides

Environment variables are merged into existing TOML values by the typed
`ts config validate`, `ts config diff`, and `ts config push` flows. They are not
read by the deployed application at request time.

```bash
# Format: TRUSTED_SERVER__SECTION__FIELD
export TRUSTED_SERVER__PUBLISHER__DOMAIN=publisher.com
export TRUSTED_SERVER__PUBLISHER__ORIGIN_URL=https://origin.publisher.com
# Secret overrides, when needed, are key names, not secret values.
export TRUSTED_SERVER__PUBLISHER__PROXY_SECRET=publisher_proxy_secret
export TRUSTED_SERVER__EC__PROVIDER=hmac
export TRUSTED_SERVER__EC__HMAC__PASSPHRASE=ec_passphrase

# Replace the rejected placeholder values in trusted-server.toml, then validate.
ts config validate
ts config push --adapter fastly
```

### Static secret references

Static app-config credentials contain stable key names only. This includes
publisher, trusted-client-IP, EC, handler, Tinybird, DataDome, and S3 fields:

- `publisher.proxy_secret`
- `trusted_client_ip.shared_secret`, when trusted client-IP forwarding is configured
- `ec.hmac.passphrase`, when `[ec] provider = "hmac"`
- `ec.host_signals.passphrase`, when `[ec] provider = "host_signals"`
- `ec.partners[*].api_token`, when inbound identify or batch sync is used
- `ec.partners[*].ts_pull_token`, when pull sync is enabled
- `handlers[*].password`
- `tinybird.auction_token_secret`, when Tinybird auction telemetry is enabled
- `integration.datadome.server_side_key_secret_name`, when protection is enabled
- `integration.datadome.protection_test_bypass.credential_secret_name`, when the bypass is enabled
- `proxy.asset_routes[*].auth.access_key_id`, `secret_access_key`, and optional `session_token`

Their values belong in the logical `trusted_server_secrets` store and are
resolved only while an instance builds runtime settings. An adapter can map the
logical ID to a different physical name. For example, Fastly commonly maps
`trusted_server_secrets` to physical store `ts_secrets`.

Two accepted secret-shaped fields are deliberately different:

- `trusted_client_ip.shared_secret` is an inline value in the app-config blob;
  it is redacted by debug formatting but is not resolved from a secret store.
- `tinybird.access_token_secret` is deprecated input. It is accepted for
  migration, then discarded and omitted from serialized config; use
  `tinybird.auction_token_secret` as the store key name instead.

The four deprecated `secret_store` selectors under Tinybird, DataDome, its
protection-test bypass, and S3 route authentication are also accepted and
discarded. Store selection comes from the adapter's EdgeZero mapping.

::: warning CLI output and inline secrets
`ts config diff`, `ts config push --dry-run`, and the interactive push preview
can print deliberately inline values. Use `ts config push --no-diff` when that
output is not safe for the current terminal or CI log. The flag suppresses the
diff; it does not move inline values to a secret store.

The following table records the independent lifecycle, key-identity,
serialization, runtime, and secret axes for every exceptional field:

Prepare an initial reference-based deployment in this order:

1. Create the physical store and configure its `trusted_server_secrets` mapping.
2. Choose a stable key name for each active credential field in the app config.
3. Write each credential value under its referenced key without exposing it in
   command arguments, shell history, logs, or CI output.
4. Run `ts config validate`, then `ts config push --adapter fastly`.
5. Start or deploy instances after the store and pushed config are both ready.

Migrate an existing deployment in this order:

1. Populate the physical store mapped from `trusted_server_secrets` with the
   existing credential values without printing them in shell history, logs, or
   CI output.
2. Replace each active credential value with a stable key name and remove the
   legacy Tinybird, DataDome, and S3 `secret_store` selectors.
3. Run `ts config validate`, then `ts config push --adapter fastly --no-diff`.
4. Restart/redeploy instances as needed to load the new values. Rotation is
   startup-scoped; changing a store value does not alter already-built state.

Keep `publisher.proxy_secret` and the selected Edge Cookie provider's
passphrase stable unless intentionally rotating signed URLs or EC identifiers.
On Spin, the app-config blob is stored
under the `trusted_server_config` key in Spin's built-in `default` key-value
store. Set the corresponding CLI store mapping before pushing so the write
matches the runtime lookup:

```bash
export EDGEZERO__STORES__CONFIG__TRUSTED_SERVER_CONFIG__NAME=default
ts config push --adapter spin
```

For local Spin development, add `--local` to the push command. Also declare a
component variable for each chosen secret key name using the encoder documented
in `spin.toml`. Missing stores, keys, invalid UTF-8, and empty values fail
closed; inline plaintext fallback is not supported.

### Tinybird auction telemetry

Tinybird uses the same typed secret-reference path as the other static
credentials. Do not configure a feature-specific store:

```toml
[tinybird]
enabled = true
api_host = "api.example.com"
auction_dataset = "auction_events_raw"
auction_token_secret = "tinybird_auction_append_token"
```

Store the APPEND token value under `tinybird_auction_append_token` in the
physical store mapped from `trusted_server_secrets`. The token is resolved once
at startup. Disabled Tinybird telemetry does not require or resolve the token.
The legacy `tinybird.secret_store` field is accepted for one migration release,
but it is ignored and omitted from newly pushed config.

### Generate Secure Secrets

Generate values locally and write them directly to the platform secret store;
do not put the generated output in `trusted-server.toml` or the app-config blob.

```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### Strict Key Validation

Trusted Server rejects unknown TOML keys in runtime configuration. Before pushing
or upgrading config, remove stale fields and typos; otherwise config loading can
fail and the service will return its startup-error response.

## Configuration Files

| File                  | Purpose                         |

## Key Sections

7 of these sections are provider types. Each takes a `provider` key
and gives each selected provider its own `[<type>.<name>]` settings table, as
[Configuration Rules](/guide/configuration-rules) describes.

## Example: Production Setup

Generate and substitute every placeholder value before validation or
deployment.

```toml
[publisher]
domain = "publisher.com"
cookie_domain = ".publisher.com"
origin_url = "https://origin.publisher.com"
proxy_secret = "publisher_proxy_secret"

[ec]
provider = "hmac"

[ec.hmac]
passphrase = "ec_passphrase"

[request_signing]
enabled = true
config_store_id = "01GXXX"
secret_store_id = "01GYYY"

[integration]
provider = ["prebid"]

[integration.prebid]
client_side_bidders = ["example-browser-bidder"]
external_bundle_url = "https://assets.example.com/prebid/trusted-prebid.js"

[proxy]
allowed_domains = ["assets.example.com"]

[auction]
enabled = true
timeout_ms = 2000

[demand]
provider = ["pbs_main"]

[demand.pbs_main]
implementation = "prebid_server"
endpoint = "https://prebid.example.com/openrtb2/auction"
timeout_ms = 1200
routing = "explicit"
debug = false

[auction.bidders.example-server-bidder]
provider = "pbs_main"
```

## Detailed Reference

The sections below consolidate the full configuration reference on this page.

## Environment Variable Overrides (Typed CLI)

Environment variables with the `TRUSTED_SERVER__` prefix are merged into the
base TOML configuration by `ts config validate`, `ts config diff`, and
`ts config push`. The resolved values are validated and, for `config push`,
stored in the app-config blob. Changing an environment variable requires
rerunning validation and pushing the resolved config, not rebuilding the binary.

The pinned EdgeZero loader only overrides leaves that already exist in the
parsed TOML; it does not create missing fields. Add newly introduced defaulted
fields to an existing config before relying on their environment overrides.
Secret overlays still contain key names, never secret values. Pass `--no-env`
to use file values without the overlay.

### Format

```
TRUSTED_SERVER__SECTION__SUBSECTION__FIELD
```

**Rules**:

- Prefix: `TRUSTED_SERVER`
- Separator: `__` (double underscore)
- Case: UPPERCASE
- Sections: Match TOML hierarchy
- Provider names are snake_case, so a provider table maps
  straight onto a path segment. `[demand.pbs_main] debug` is
  `TRUSTED_SERVER__DEMAND__PBS_MAIN__DEBUG`.

A provider setting overrides like any other scalar leaf:

```bash
export TRUSTED_SERVER__DEMAND__PBS_MAIN__DEBUG=true
ts config validate
```

This example changes an existing scalar leaf. Edit TOML and run `ts config
validate` followed by `ts config push` when changing an array, table, map, or
rule. A `provider` list is an array, so it cannot be overridden this way.

## Publisher Configuration

Core publisher settings for domain, origin, and proxy configuration.

### `[publisher]`

| Field                         | Type    | Required | Description                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `domain`                      | String  | Yes      | Publisher's apex domain name                                                |
| `cookie_domain`               | String  | Yes      | Domain for non-EC cookies (typically with leading dot)                      |
| `origin_url`                  | String  | Yes      | Full URL of publisher origin server                                         |
| `origin_host_header_override` | String  | No       | Outbound Host header to send while connecting to `origin_url`               |
| `proxy_secret`                | String  | Yes      | Secret-store key name for the proxy URL secret                              |
| `max_buffered_body_bytes`     | Integer | No       | Buffered-body cap / Fastly stream raw+decoded byte ceiling (default 16 MiB) |

> **Note:** EC cookies (`ts-ec`) derive their domain automatically as `.{domain}` and
> do not use `cookie_domain`. The `cookie_domain` field is used by other cookie helpers.

**Example** (replace the rejected secret placeholder before validation):

```toml
[publisher]
domain = "publisher.com"
cookie_domain = ".publisher.com"
origin_url = "https://origin.publisher.com"
# Optional: connect to origin_url but send this outbound Host header.
# origin_host_header_override = "www.publisher.com"
proxy_secret = "publisher_proxy_secret"
```

**Environment Override**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__PUBLISHER__DOMAIN=publisher.com
TRUSTED_SERVER__PUBLISHER__COOKIE_DOMAIN=.publisher.com
TRUSTED_SERVER__PUBLISHER__ORIGIN_URL=https://origin.publisher.com
TRUSTED_SERVER__PUBLISHER__ORIGIN_HOST_HEADER_OVERRIDE=www.publisher.com
TRUSTED_SERVER__PUBLISHER__PROXY_SECRET=publisher_proxy_secret
TRUSTED_SERVER__PUBLISHER__MAX_BUFFERED_BODY_BYTES=16777216
```

### Field Details

#### `domain`

**Purpose**: Primary domain for the publisher.

**Usage**:

- Used for publisher routing and logging
- Part of request context for proxy/origin handling

**Format**: Hostname without protocol or path

- ✅ `publisher.com`
- ✅ `www.publisher.com`
- ❌ `https://publisher.com`
- ❌ `publisher.com/path`

#### `cookie_domain`

**Purpose**: Domain scope for non-EC cookies.

**Usage**:

- Used by non-EC cookie helpers for domain scoping
- EC cookies (`ts-ec`) use a separate computed domain derived from `domain`

**Format**: Domain with optional leading dot

- `.publisher.com` - Shares across all subdomains
- `publisher.com` - Exact domain only

**Best Practice**: Use leading dot (`.publisher.com`) for subdomain sharing.

#### `origin_url`

**Purpose**: Backend origin server URL for publisher content.

**Usage**:

- Fallback proxy target for non-integration requests
- HTML processing rewrites origin URLs to request host
- Base for relative URL resolution

**Format**: Full URL with protocol

- ✅ `https://origin.publisher.com`
- ✅ `https://origin.publisher.com:8080`
- ✅ `http://192.168.1.1:9000`
- ❌ `origin.publisher.com` (missing protocol)

**Port Handling**: Includes port if non-standard (not 80/443).

#### `origin_host_header_override`

**Purpose**: Optional Host header to send to the publisher origin while still
connecting to the host in `origin_url`.

**Usage**:

- Connects, uses SNI, and checks certificates against `origin_url`
- Sends the configured value as the outbound HTTP `Host` header
- Useful when the origin endpoint expects a canonical publisher hostname

**Format**: Hostname with optional port, without protocol, path, query, or fragment

- ✅ `www.publisher.com`
- ✅ `www.publisher.com:8443`
- ❌ `https://www.publisher.com`
- ❌ `www.publisher.com/path`

**Default**: When omitted, Trusted Server sends the host from `origin_url`.

#### `proxy_secret`

**Purpose**: Secret-store key name for the HMAC-SHA256 value used to sign proxy URLs.

The referenced value is resolved from `trusted_server_secrets` at startup.
Generate it with a cryptographically secure random source; at least 32 random
bytes are recommended. Keep that value confidential, rotate it only
intentionally, and never put it in the TOML file or pushed app-config blob.

**Usage**:

- Signs `/first-party/proxy` URLs
- Signs `/first-party/click` URLs
- Validates incoming proxy requests
- Prevents URL tampering

::: danger Security Warning
Changing `proxy_secret` invalidates all existing signed URLs. Plan rotations carefully and use graceful transition periods.
:::

#### `max_buffered_body_bytes`

**Purpose**: Upper bound on how much of a publisher origin body the rewrite
pipeline holds in memory, being the post-rewrite output buffer on buffered adapters,
and the per-stream raw/decoded byte ceiling on the Fastly streaming path.

**Usage**:

- On **buffered adapters** (Axum, Cloudflare, Spin) it caps the _decoded,
  post-rewrite_ output buffer for a publisher response processed in full. It
  also bounds how much decoded gzip output may sit in the heap at any one
  moment, so a decompression bomb is rejected mid-decode rather than after its
  full expansion. That second bound is per-step, not a total: a gzip-encoded
  response passes or fails on the same post-rewrite output size as the identity,
  deflate and brotli versions of the same body.
- On the **Fastly streaming path** the origin body is preserved as a stream, so
  the same value caps the stream twice over: the cumulative _raw_ (still
  compressed) bytes pulled from origin, and the cumulative _decoded_ bytes
  emitted by the decompressor. The decoded cap is enforced _during_
  decompression, so a decompression bomb is rejected before its expansion is
  materialized rather than after.

**Behavior when exceeded**:

- On **buffered adapters** the response fails before any bytes are committed.
- On the **streaming path** the response headers are already committed when
  either cap trips, so the body is **truncated mid-stream** and the error is
  logged, and the client receives a short (incomplete) body rather than a `5xx`.
  Size the cap above your largest expected decoded page so legitimate responses
  are never truncated.

**Default**: `16777216` (16 MiB). On the Fastly streaming path this is now the
sole ceiling: origin bodies are streamed rather than materialized in full, so
the previous ~10 MiB raw-body limit no longer applies.

**Minimum**: Must be at least `1`. A value of `0` is rejected at startup because
a zero-byte cap fails every non-empty publisher response.

**Environment Override**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__PUBLISHER__MAX_BUFFERED_BODY_BYTES=16777216
```

## Trusted Client IP Configuration

Use this optional section when a trusted CDN service forwards requests to the
Fastly service running Trusted Server. It lets Trusted Server use the reader's
address instead of the immediate fronting edge node's address. Only the Fastly
adapter honours this section; the Cloudflare, Spin, and Axum adapters validate
it but keep using their own runtime client address.

### `[trusted_client_ip]`

| Field           | Type   | Required | Description                                                      |
| --------------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ip_header`     | String | Yes      | Header containing exactly one reader IP address                  |
| `auth_header`   | String | Yes      | Header containing exactly one shared-secret value                |
| `shared_secret` | String | Yes      | Key in `trusted_server_secrets` for the front-door shared secret |

All three fields are required when the section exists. When the section is
absent, Trusted Server continues to use the immediate peer address, and
`ts config push` omits the section from the published config blob so instances
running an older binary keep accepting the blob.

::: warning Deploy the code before pushing the config
Once the section is configured, the pushed blob carries it, and `Settings`
rejects unknown fields. A binary that predates trusted client-IP support fails
to load a blob containing this section and returns its startup-error response.
Upgrade every instance before pushing a config that enables the section, and
restore a config without the section before rolling instances back. Getting
this order wrong takes the service down rather than degrading it.
:::

```toml
[trusted_client_ip]
ip_header = "x-ts-client-ip"
auth_header = "x-ts-client-ip-auth"
shared_secret = "trusted_client_ip_shared_secret"
```

Prefer a dedicated `x-` name for `ip_header`, as shown. `fastly-client-ip` is
also accepted and suits a fronting service dedicated to Trusted Server, but on
a service carrying other traffic a dedicated name means the front door never
modifies `Fastly-Client-IP`, so other consumers of that header keep working
unchanged. See [Fastly Setup](/guide/fastly#cdn-fronted-client-ip) for the
front-door configuration this section depends on.

The front door must overwrite both headers on every request it forwards to
Trusted Server, and must remove client-supplied copies on its other routes.
Trusted Server resolves `shared_secret` from `trusted_server_secrets` at startup.
It accepts the forwarded address only when the request has exactly one
`auth_header` value that matches the resolved secret byte-for-byte and exactly
one `ip_header` value that parses directly as IPv4 or IPv6. Values are not
trimmed or normalized. Missing, empty, duplicate, non-UTF-8, mismatched, or malformed
values do not reject the request; Trusted Server safely falls back to the
immediate peer address. Both configured headers are removed before routing.

Header names are validated case-insensitively. `ip_header` must be
`fastly-client-ip` or start with `x-`, while `auth_header` must start with `x-`.
The names must differ. Neither field may use a header name reserved for
Trusted Server's own internal signals (for example `x-forwarded-for`,
`x-geo-info-available`, `x-ts-ec`, `x-ts-tls-protocol`, or `x-ts-tls-cipher`);
the full reserved set is the internal-header list that Trusted Server strips
before forwarding to third parties. These restrictions exclude standard
sensitive headers such as `Host`, `Content-Length`, `Cookie`, and
`Authorization`, as well as every Trusted Server internal header. Choose
dedicated `x-` names that no other application or routing logic uses, because
Trusted Server removes the configured headers before routing.

Generate the referenced secret value with a cryptographically secure random
generator, encode it as hex or base64url, and store the same value only in the
front door and the physical store mapped from `trusted_server_secrets`. Put only
the key name in Trusted Server configuration. The resolved value must contain at
least 32 ASCII graphic bytes (`!` through `~`) with no whitespace, controls, DEL,
or non-ASCII bytes.

Independently of this section, the Fastly adapter treats `fastly-client-ip` as
client-spoofable and strips it at request entry, so Trusted Server no longer
forwards an inbound `Fastly-Client-IP` to the publisher origin. This applies
even when `[trusted_client_ip]` is absent. Check whether the origin reads that
header before deploying.

Startup fails closed if the configured key is missing, empty, invalid UTF-8, or
resolves to an invalid shared-secret value. Every adapter removes the configured
IP and authentication headers before routing, although only Fastly uses them for
client-IP resolution.

**Environment Overrides**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__TRUSTED_CLIENT_IP__IP_HEADER=x-ts-client-ip
TRUSTED_SERVER__TRUSTED_CLIENT_IP__AUTH_HEADER=x-ts-client-ip-auth
TRUSTED_SERVER__TRUSTED_CLIENT_IP__SHARED_SECRET=trusted_client_ip_shared_secret
```

Because the typed environment overlay cannot create a missing section, add
`[trusted_client_ip]` and all three fields to the TOML before using these
overrides.

## Tester Cookie Configuration

Settings for the optional tester-cookie endpoints. This feature is disabled by
default and should only be enabled for intentional QA or troubleshooting flows.

### `[tester_cookie]`

| Field     | Type    | Required | Description                                        |
| --------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled` | Boolean | No       | Enables routes to set and clear `ts-tester` cookie |

When enabled, `GET /_ts/set-tester` returns `204 No Content` and sets:

```http
Set-Cookie: ts-tester=true; Domain=<publisher.cookie_domain>; Path=/; Secure; SameSite=Lax
Cache-Control: no-store, private
```

`GET /_ts/clear-tester` returns `204 No Content` and clears the cookie:

```http
Set-Cookie: ts-tester=; Domain=<publisher.cookie_domain>; Path=/; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Max-Age=0
Cache-Control: no-store, private
```

When disabled, both routes return `404 Not Found` and do not set a cookie.

::: warning
The cookie is scoped with `[publisher].cookie_domain`, not the EC-specific
computed domain. Keep `cookie_domain` aligned with the browser scope where your
QA tooling expects to read `ts-tester`.
:::

**Example**:

```toml
[tester_cookie]
enabled = true
```

**Environment Override**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__TESTER_COOKIE__ENABLED=true
```

## EC Configuration

Settings for Edge Cookie identifier generation. The `ec_store` KV store is the only KV-backed EC lifecycle store. It holds identity graph state, minimal consent metadata, source-domain keyed partner UIDs, and withdrawal tombstones. Consent configuration controls request-local interpretation and forwarding, not separate KV persistence.

### `[ec]`

| Field                     | Type           | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `pull_sync_concurrency`   | Integer        | No       | Maximum concurrent pull-sync requests per organic response                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `cluster_trust_threshold` | Integer        | No       | Cluster size threshold for identity trust decisions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `partners`                | Array          | No       | Static partner registry entries                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Each provider that has settings is configured in its own `[ec.<name>]` table, and the `provider` selector names which table is active. A table may set `implementation = "<id>"` to say which provider it configures, which makes the table name a label of your choosing, so `provider = "primary"` with `[ec.primary]` holding `implementation = "hmac"` configures the built-in provider under a name that means something to your deployment. Provider names and implementation ids are `snake_case`.

A provider has a table only when it has settings of its own. Both providers that derive an identifier at the edge take a passphrase, so selecting `hmac` or `host_signals` without its table fails at startup, while the `client_fixed` demonstration provider needs no table at all. A table the selector does not name also fails at startup, so a stale table cannot sit unnoticed.

`ec_store`, `partners` and the cluster thresholds are settings of the job
rather than of one provider, so they sit directly in `[ec]` whichever provider
is selected.

A provider an integration supplies also needs that integration named in
`[integration] provider`.

### `[ec.hmac]`

A provider an integration supplies also needs that integration named in
`[integration] provider`.

### `[ec.hmac]`

The built-in HMAC-over-client-IP provider, named `hmac`.

`passphrase` is a key name in `trusted_server_secrets`, and the resolved value
must be at least 32 bytes. Keep it stable to preserve EC identifier continuity.

| Field        | Type   | Required                    | Description                                                |
| ------------ | ------ | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `passphrase` | String | Yes when `hmac` is selected | Secret-store key name whose resolved value is the HMAC key |

### `[ec.host_signals]`

The built-in provider that derives the identifier from the host's TLS JA4 and
HTTP/2 signals together with the client address, so it needs a host that
supplies those signals. It takes a `passphrase` on the same terms as
`[ec.hmac]`.

::: tip Partner keying
`source_domain` is the canonical partner key. It matches incoming OpenRTB EID `source` values and is also used as the EC KV `ids` map key.
:::

`api_token` is optional. Set it to a key in `trusted_server_secrets` only when
the partner calls the inbound identify or batch-sync APIs. A partner without
`api_token` remains available for source-domain lookup, bidstream EIDs, and
outbound pull sync, but cannot authenticate to those inbound APIs.

**Example**:

```toml
[ec]
provider = "hmac"
ec_store = "ec_identity_store"

[ec.hmac]
passphrase = "ec_passphrase"

[[ec.partners]]
name = "Mocktioneer SSP"
source_domain = "mocktioneer.example"
bidstream_enabled = true
# api_token = "partner_api_token"  # only for inbound identify or batch sync
# ts_pull_token = "partner_ts_pull_token"  # required when pull sync is enabled
```

**Environment Override**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__EC__PROVIDER=hmac
TRUSTED_SERVER__EC__HMAC__PASSPHRASE=ec_passphrase
TRUSTED_SERVER__EC__EC_STORE=ec_identity_store
```

These `TRUSTED_SERVER__` overrides apply where deployment tooling merges environment values into the published configuration (for example test harnesses building an app-config blob). The running server reads its settings from the platform config store, so provider selection changes take effect when a new configuration is pushed, not per request.

### Field Details

#### `provider`

**Purpose**: Names the active Edge Cookie provider. Omit to run statelessly with no Edge Cookie.

**Validation**: Application startup fails if the name is not `snake_case`, if it names a key the `[ec]` section reads as its own setting, if the selected provider has no `[ec.<name>]` table where it needs one, if it names a provider this build does not have, or if a table the selector does not name is configured. `ts config validate` does not run these checks, so start an instance to confirm a change to `[ec]`.

#### `hmac.passphrase`

**Purpose**: Secret-store key name whose resolved value is the HMAC key for EC ID generation, read when `provider = "hmac"`.

**Security**:

- The key name is stored in app config, and the value is stored in `trusted_server_secrets`
- Keep the value stable unless intentionally rotating EC identifiers
- Do not place the value in environment overlays or the pushed blob

**Validation**: Application startup fails if the resolved value is:

- Empty
- Shorter than 32 characters

## Device Configuration

Selects how a request is classified into the coarse device signals the Edge Cookie bot gate uses, mirroring the Edge Cookie provider selection. These signals serve identifier gating and bot detection, not bid enrichment.

### `[device]`

| Field      | Type           | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `provider` | String or null | No       | Name of the device-detection provider: `builtin` (the default, User-Agent only, no host-specific call), `fastly` to add the host's TLS (JA4) and HTTP/2 probabilistic identifiers, or a provider an integration supplies |

The default `builtin` provider classifies from the User-Agent alone and makes no host-specific call, so the default path stays host-neutral. Neither `builtin` nor `fastly` has settings, so neither needs a `[device.<name>]` table. Selecting a provider this build does not have fails at startup.

**Example**:

```toml
[device]
provider = "builtin" # or "fastly" to add TLS and HTTP/2 evidence
```

**Environment Override**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__DEVICE__PROVIDER=builtin
```

## Geo Configuration

Selects how a client IP is resolved into geolocation (country, region, coordinates), mirroring the Edge Cookie provider selection. The resolved country also feeds the [permission model](/guide/permission-model).

### `[geo]`

| Field                        | Type           | Required        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `provider`                   | String or null | No              | Name of the geo provider: `platform` to use the host's own geo lookup, `none` (or omit it) to resolve no location and make no host geo call, or a provider an integration supplies                               |
| `assume_single_jurisdiction` | Boolean        | See description | With no geo provider, every request resolves at the top of the `permissions.yaml` rules tree. A deployment that runs an Edge Cookie provider without a geo provider acknowledges that by setting this to `true`. |

`assume_single_jurisdiction` is a setting of the job rather than of one
provider, so it sits directly in `[geo]`.

No provider is the default, so a default deployment is not tied to any host geo service. Selecting a provider this build does not have fails at startup. A failed geo lookup at request time resolves every permission to the requires-signal floor and is logged at error level, so an outage is handled protectively.

**Example**:

```toml
[geo]
provider = "platform"
```

**Environment Override**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__GEO__PROVIDER=platform
```

## Permission Signal Configuration

Which permission signals Trusted Server acts on, and in what order. Signals
compose rather than select, because a request can carry a TCF string and a
Global Privacy Control header at once and both have something to say, so this
type takes a list. The order is the policy, because the last provider with an
opinion decides.

### `[permission_signal]`

| Field      | Type          | Required | Description                                                                                                    |
| ---------- | ------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `provider` | Array[String] | No       | The providers to act on, in order. Omit it to act on every provider this build links, in the order shown below |

The providers that ship are `gpc` (the `Sec-GPC` request header),
`gpp_sale_opt_out` (a GPP US sale opt-out), `us_privacy` (a US Privacy string
sale opt-out) and `tcf` (TCF v2). Each is a crate under
`crates/permission-signal`, outside the core.

A provider that is not on the list does not run, and there is no separate
switch to turn one off. An empty list acts on nothing, leaving every
permission at its country and region baseline. An unknown or repeated name
refuses startup. None of the four has settings, so none needs a
`[permission_signal.<name>]` table.

**Example**:

```toml
[permission_signal]
provider = ["gpc", "gpp_sale_opt_out", "us_privacy", "tcf"]
```

See [Permission Signals](/guide/permission-signals) for what each provider
reads and how to add a scheme.

## Provider Permissions

A provider advertises the technical permissions its data use requires, and Trusted Server runs the provider only when every required permission is set. This separates legal policy from the core, so the deployer brings the policy that decides how permissions are established. See the [Permission Model](/guide/permission-model) for the concept, the permission vocabulary, and how a request resolves.

### Country and region rules (`permissions.yaml`)

The country and region permission rules are defined in a human-editable permissions YAML document, compiled into the build (not loaded at runtime). The repository sample is `config/permissions/sample.yaml`, which is for testing and evaluation only and is neither a production policy nor legal advice. Edit or replace the compiled-in file and rebuild to change the policy. There is no `[permissions]` block in `trusted-server.toml`. It defines named **groups** (baselines such as `gdpr-eu`, `gdpr-uk`, `us-opt-out`) and **rules** that map a country or country/state to a group, with an optional `permissions` map that overrides single Data Uses (`granted`, `requires_signal`, or `denied`). A request that matches no rule resolves at the top of the rules tree. See the [Permission Model](/guide/permission-model) for the schema and the repository sample.

## Consent Configuration

`[consent]` controls request-local interpretation and forwarding of privacy
signals. It does not create a second consent database. Set `consent_store` to a
KV store name only when consent should persist with the EC identity graph.

### `[consent]`

| Field                                          | Type           | Default                     | Contract                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |

```toml
[consent]
mode = "interpreter"
check_expiration = true
max_consent_age_days = 395

[consent.conflict_resolution]
mode = "restrictive"
freshness_threshold_days = 30
```

`applies_in` and `privacy_states` are policy inputs. Review them against the
publisher's operating jurisdictions instead of assuming the built-in lists are
legal advice.

## Response Headers

Custom headers added to all responses.

### `[response_headers]`

**Purpose**: Add custom HTTP headers to every response.

**Format**: Key-value pairs

**Example**:

```toml
[response_headers]
X-Custom-Header = "custom value"
X-Publisher-ID = "pub-12345"
X-Environment = "production"
Cache-Control = "public, max-age=3600"
```

**Environment Override**:

Override an existing header leaf by preserving its TOML key punctuation in the
environment path. Shell assignment syntax cannot contain hyphens, so use `env`:

```bash
env 'TRUSTED_SERVER__RESPONSE_HEADERS__X-CUSTOM-HEADER=updated value' \
  ts config validate
```

The overlay cannot add a header or replace the whole `response_headers` table.
Edit TOML, validate, and push again for those changes.

**Use Cases**:

- Custom measurement headers
- Cache control overrides
- Debugging identifiers
- CORS headers (if needed)

::: warning Header Precedence
Custom headers may be overwritten by application logic. Standard headers (`Content-Type`, `Content-Length`) are controlled by the application.
:::

## Request Signing

Configuration for Ed25519 request signing and JWKS management.

### `[request_signing]`

| Field             | Type    | Required            | Description                             |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`         | Boolean | No (default: false) | Enable request signing features         |
| `config_store_id` | String  | If enabled          | Fastly Config Store ID for JWKS         |
| `secret_store_id` | String  | If enabled          | Fastly Secret Store ID for private keys |

**Example**:

```toml
[request_signing]
enabled = true
config_store_id = "01GXXX"  # From Fastly dashboard
secret_store_id = "01GYYY"  # From Fastly dashboard
```

**Environment Override**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__REQUEST_SIGNING__ENABLED=true
TRUSTED_SERVER__REQUEST_SIGNING__CONFIG_STORE_ID=01GXXX
TRUSTED_SERVER__REQUEST_SIGNING__SECRET_STORE_ID=01GYYY
```

### Store Setup

**Config Store** (for public keys):

```bash
# Create store
fastly config-store create --name=jwks_store

# Get store ID
fastly config-store list
```

**Secret Store** (for private keys):

```bash
# Create store
fastly secret-store create --name=signing_keys

# Get store ID
fastly secret-store list
```

**Local Dev Setup** (`fastly.toml`):

```toml
[local_server.config_stores]
  [local_server.config_stores.jwks_store]
    file = "test-data/jwks_store.json"

[local_server.secret_stores]
  [local_server.secret_stores.signing_keys]
    file = "test-data/signing_keys.json"
```

See [Request Signing](/guide/request-signing) and [Key Rotation](/guide/key-rotation) for usage.

## Basic Authentication Handlers

Path-based HTTP Basic Authentication.

### `[[handlers]]`

**Purpose**: Protect specific paths with username/password authentication.

**Format**: Array of handler objects

| Field      | Type           | Required | Description                       |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| `path`     | String (Regex) | Yes      | Regular expression matching paths |
| `username` | String         | Yes      | HTTP Basic Auth username          |
| `password` | String         | Yes      | HTTP Basic Auth password          |

**Example**:

```toml
# Single handler
[[handlers]]
path = "^/_ts/admin"
username = "admin"
password = "admin_password"

# Multiple handlers
[[handlers]]
path = "^/secure"
username = "user1"
password = "secure_handler_password"

[[handlers]]
path = "^/api/private"
username = "api-user"
password = "api_handler_password"
```

**Environment Override**:

```bash
# Handler 0
TRUSTED_SERVER__HANDLERS__0__PATH="^/_ts/admin"
TRUSTED_SERVER__HANDLERS__0__USERNAME="admin"
TRUSTED_SERVER__HANDLERS__0__PASSWORD="admin_password"

# Handler 1
TRUSTED_SERVER__HANDLERS__1__PATH="^/api/private"
TRUSTED_SERVER__HANDLERS__1__USERNAME="api-user"
TRUSTED_SERVER__HANDLERS__1__PASSWORD="api_handler_password"
```

### Path Patterns

**Regex Syntax**: Standard Rust regex patterns

**Examples**:

```toml
# Exact path
path = "^/_ts/admin$"  # Only /_ts/admin

# Prefix match
path = "^/_ts/admin"   # /_ts/admin, /_ts/admin/users, /_ts/admin/settings

# Multiple paths
path = "^/(admin|secure|private)"

# File extension
path = "\\.pdf$"   # All PDF files

# Complex pattern
path = "^/api/v[0-9]+/private"  # /api/v1/private, /api/v2/private
```

**Validation**: Application startup fails if regex is invalid.

::: warning Admin coverage and passwords are validated at startup

Startup fails when no handler covers an admin route. The dynamic
`/_ts/admin/ec/{id}` route accepts any segment after `/_ts/admin/ec/`, and
Basic Auth runs on the raw path before routing, so coverage cannot be inferred
from ID-shaped samples: a pattern such as
`^/_ts/admin/ec/hmac~[a-f0-9]{64}[.][A-Za-z0-9]{6}$` is rejected. Use a prefix-level
matcher (`^/_ts/admin`, or `^/_ts/admin/ec/` alongside the other admin
patterns).

Handler expressions match the raw URI path, while a publisher origin may decode
percent-encoded aliases before routing. For a whole-site staging gate, use
`path = "^/"`; do not rely on a decoded-path prefix such as `^/secure` to protect
equivalent origin paths.

Startup also fails when any handler, admin or not, uses a placeholder or
well-known weak password (`changeme`, `password`, `admin`, or a
`replace-with-…` template value). Handler selection is first-match-wins, so a
narrow handler ahead of the admin pattern governs the paths it matches.

:::

::: warning Scope patterns to the paths you mean

Handler patterns are matched against the full request path, so a broad pattern
covers everything beneath it. The `/_ts/` namespace holds both admin routes and
browser-facing endpoints that anonymous visitors must be able to reach:

| Path                     | Called by                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `/_ts/page-bids`         | Trusted Server JS, on SPA navigation |
| `/_ts/api/v1/identify`   | Trusted Server JS, in the browser    |
| `/_ts/api/v1/batch-sync` | Trusted Server JS, in the browser    |

A pattern such as `path = "^/_ts"` puts those behind Basic Auth. Browser
fetches never carry Basic credentials, so every visitor gets `401`, on
`/_ts/page-bids` that means no ads after any client-side navigation. Match the
admin routes specifically (`^/_ts/admin`) instead.

Upgrading from a release before `/_ts/page-bids` existed: if any handler
pattern covers it, narrow the pattern. The Trusted Server JS bundle falls back
to the deprecated `/__ts/page-bids` alias in the meantime, but that alias is
scheduled for removal
([#970](https://github.com/IABTechLab/trusted-server/issues/970)).

:::

### Security Considerations

**Password Storage**:

- `handlers[*].password` is a key name in `trusted_server_secrets`
- Store the resolved password only in the platform secret store
- Rotate passwords through the store and restart/redeploy instances

**Limitations**:

- HTTP Basic Auth (not OAuth/JWT)
- Single username/password per path
- No role-based access control
- No rate limiting (add at edge)

::: warning Production Use
Do not put handler passwords in `trusted-server.toml`, environment overlays, or
app-config blobs. Provision the referenced key in `trusted_server_secrets`
before pushing the config.
:::

## URL Rewrite Configuration

Control which domains are excluded from first-party rewriting.

### `[rewrite]`

| Field             | Type          | Required         | Description               |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| `exclude_domains` | Array[String] | No (default: []) | Domains to skip rewriting |

**Example**:

```toml
[rewrite]
exclude_domains = [
    "*.cdn.trusted-partner.com",  # Wildcard
    "first-party.publisher.com",  # Exact match
    "localhost",                  # Development
]
```

**Environment Override**:

EdgeZero v0.0.4 cannot replace this array or address its elements by index. Edit
`exclude_domains` in TOML, then validate and push the file again.

### Pattern Matching

**Wildcard Patterns** (`*`):

```toml
"*.cdn.example.com"
```

Matches:

- ✅ `assets.cdn.example.com`
- ✅ `images.cdn.example.com`
- ✅ `cdn.example.com` (base domain)
- ❌ `cdn.example.com.evil.com` (different domain)

**Exact Patterns** (no `*`):

```toml
"api.example.com"
```

Matches:

- ✅ `api.example.com`
- ❌ `www.api.example.com`
- ❌ `api.example.com.evil.com`

### Use Cases

**Trusted Partners**:

```toml
exclude_domains = ["*.approved-cdn.com"]
```

**First-Party Resources**:

```toml
exclude_domains = ["assets.publisher.com", "static.publisher.com"]
```

**Development**:

```toml
exclude_domains = ["localhost", "127.0.0.1", "*.local"]
```

**Performance** (already first-party):

```toml
exclude_domains = ["*.publisher.com"]  # Skip unnecessary proxying
```

See [Creative Processing](/guide/creative-processing#exclude-domains) for details.

## Proxy Configuration

Controls first-party proxy security settings and path-based asset routes.

### `[proxy]`

| Field               | Type          | Required             | Description                                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `allowed_domains`   | Array[String] | No (default: `[]`)   | Hosts permitted for signing, initial fetches, and redirects |
| `certificate_check` | Boolean       | No (default: `true`) | Verify TLS certificates when proxying HTTPS origins         |
| `asset_routes`      | Array[Table]  | No (default: `[]`)   | Path prefixes proxied directly to configured origins        |

**Example**:

```toml
[proxy]
allowed_domains = [
  "assets.example.com",  # Exact match
  "*.cdn.example.com",   # Wildcard: cdn.example.com and all subdomains
]
```

**Environment Override**:

EdgeZero v0.0.4 cannot replace this array or address its elements by index. Edit
`allowed_domains` in TOML, then validate and push the file again.

### Field Details

#### `allowed_domains`

**Purpose**: Allowlist of target hosts permitted for `/first-party/sign` and `/first-party/proxy`. When `integration.prebid.external_bundle_url` is configured, this list must cover its host and any HTTPS redirect targets.

**Behavior**: Trusted Server checks the parsed host before signing a target, before fetching the initial proxy target, and before following each HTTP redirect (301/302/303/307/308). A host that does not match the list is blocked with a 403 error.

**Default - open mode**: When `allowed_domains` is absent or empty and no external Prebid bundle is configured, every valid host is allowed for signing, initial fetches, and redirects. Configuring an external Prebid bundle with an empty list fails deploy validation. Open mode supports zero-config development but should not be used in production.

**Pattern Matching**:

| Pattern              | Matches                                                            | Does not match           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| `assets.example.com` | `assets.example.com`                                               | `sub.assets.example.com` |
| `*.cdn.example.com`  | `cdn.example.com`, `static.cdn.example.com`, `a.b.cdn.example.com` | `evil-cdn.example.com`   |

- `"example.com"` matches that host exactly and nothing else.
- `"*.example.com"` matches the base domain and any subdomain at any depth.
- Matching is case-insensitive; entries are normalized to lowercase at startup.
- Blank entries are ignored.
- The `*` wildcard requires a dot boundary: `*.example.com` does **not** match `evil-example.com`.

::: danger Production Recommendation
Always configure `allowed_domains` in production. Without an explicit allowlist, clients can sign and fetch valid URLs for arbitrary hosts, including redirect targets.

```toml
[proxy]
allowed_domains = [
  "assets.example.com",
  "*.cdn.example.com",
]
```

:::

See [First-Party Proxy](/guide/first-party-proxy#proxy-allowlist) for usage details.

#### `certificate_check`

**Purpose**: Control TLS certificate verification for HTTPS proxy and asset-route origins.

**Default**: `true`

Set this to `false` only for local development with self-signed certificates.

### `[[proxy.asset_routes]]`

Asset routes proxy selected first-party paths to an alternate asset origin without requiring signed `/first-party/proxy` URLs.

| Field             | Type   | Required | Description                                     |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `prefix`          | String | Yes      | Request path prefix to match                    |
| `origin_url`      | String | Yes      | Absolute `http` or `https` origin URL           |
| `path_pattern`    | String | No       | Regex matched against the incoming request path |
| `target_path`     | String | No       | Replacement path used with `path_pattern`       |
| `auth`            | Table  | No       | Optional origin authentication                  |
| `image_optimizer` | Table  | No       | Optional route-level Image Optimizer settings   |

**Example**:

```toml
[[proxy.asset_routes]]
prefix = "/assets/"
origin_url = "https://assets.example.com"
```

**Path rewrite example**:

```toml
[[proxy.asset_routes]]
prefix = "/.image/"
origin_url = "https://assets-cdn.example.com"
path_pattern = "^/\\.image/(.*)/[^/]+\\.([^/.]+)$"
target_path = "/image/upload/$1.$2"
```

**Behavior**:

- Only `GET` and `HEAD` requests use asset routes.
- Built-in and integration routes take precedence.
- The longest matching asset-route prefix wins.
- `path_pattern` and `target_path` must be configured together.
- `origin_url` must not include userinfo, a path, a query string, or a fragment.
- Unsafe origin response headers such as `Set-Cookie` are stripped before the response reaches the browser.

### `[proxy.asset_routes.auth]`

The first supported origin auth type is `s3_sigv4`.

| Field               | Type   | Required | Default             | Description                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `type`              | String | Yes      | none                | Must be `s3_sigv4`                                           |
| `region`            | String | Yes      | none                | AWS region used in the SigV4 credential scope                |
| `access_key_id`     | String | No       | `access_key_id`     | Default-store secret reference for the AWS access key ID     |
| `secret_access_key` | String | No       | `secret_access_key` | Default-store secret reference for the AWS secret access key |
| `session_token`     | String | No       | unset               | Optional secret key containing a session token               |
| `origin_query`      | String | No       | route default       | `preserve` or `strip`                                        |

**Example**:

```toml
[[proxy.asset_routes]]
prefix = "/.image/"
origin_url = "https://bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"

[proxy.asset_routes.auth]
type = "s3_sigv4"
region = "us-east-1"
origin_query = "strip"
access_key_id = "s3_access_key_id"
secret_access_key = "s3_secret_access_key"
# session_token = "s3_session_token"
```

S3 auth uses header-based AWS SigV4 with `UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD`. It is scoped to read-only asset requests and expects `origin_url` to use the S3 host that AWS validates. Credential references resolve from `trusted_server_secrets` at startup, and request signing performs no secret-store reads.

Effective `origin_query` precedence is auth-level `origin_query`, then enabled Image Optimizer `origin_query`, then the route default.

### `[proxy.asset_routes.image_optimizer]`

Route-level Image Optimizer configuration selects a reusable profile set.

| Field          | Type    | Required         | Default              | Description                                                                 |
| -------------- | ------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`      | Boolean | No               | `true`               | Enable Image Optimizer for the route                                        |
| `region`       | String  | Yes when enabled | none                 | Fastly IO processing region, such as `us_east`                              |
| `profile_set`  | String  | Yes when enabled | none                 | Name under `[image_optimizer.profile_sets.*]`                               |
| `origin_query` | String  | No               | `strip` when enabled | `preserve` or `strip`; effective `preserve` is rejected while IO is enabled |

**Example**:

```toml
[proxy.asset_routes.image_optimizer]
enabled = true
region = "us_east"
profile_set = "default_images"
```

### `[image_optimizer.profile_sets.<name>]`

Profile sets convert small request query controls into a closed set of Image Optimizer parameters.

| Field                | Type   | Required | Default       | Description                                      |
| -------------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `base_params`        | String | No       | `""`          | Params applied before profile-specific params    |
| `default_profile`    | String | No       | `default`     | Profile used when no profile is requested        |
| `unknown_profile`    | String | No       | `use_default` | `use_default` or `reject`                        |
| `profile_param`      | String | No       | `profile`     | Query parameter containing the profile name      |
| `aspect_ratio_param` | String | No       | `ar`          | Query parameter containing aspect ratio          |
| `debug_param`        | String | No       | `_io_debug`   | Query parameter that disables IO when set to `1` |

Profile values live under `[image_optimizer.profile_sets.<name>.profiles]` and use query-string syntax.

```toml
[image_optimizer.profile_sets.default_images]
base_params = "quality=70&resize-filter=bicubic"
default_profile = "default"
unknown_profile = "use_default"
profile_param = "profile"
aspect_ratio_param = "ar"
debug_param = "_io_debug"

[image_optimizer.profile_sets.default_images.profiles]
default = "width=1920"
medium = "format=auto&width=828"
thumbnail = "width=150&crop=1:1,smart"
```

Supported profile parameters are `quality`, `resize-filter`, `format`, `width`, `height`, and `crop`. Unknown profile parameters fail configuration validation.

### `[image_optimizer.profile_sets.<name>.aspect_ratios]`

| Field      | Type          | Required | Description                                         |
| ---------- | ------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `allowed`  | Array[String] | No       | Allowed query values such as `1-1` or `16-9`        |
| `profiles` | Array[String] | No       | Defined profiles that accept aspect-ratio overrides |

```toml
[image_optimizer.profile_sets.default_images.aspect_ratios]
allowed = ["1-1", "16-9", "4-3"]
profiles = ["medium", "thumbnail"]
```

### `[image_optimizer.profile_sets.<name>.crop_offsets]`

| Field          | Type           | Required | Default                | Description                                  |

## Tinybird Configuration

`[tinybird]` sends auction events directly to the Tinybird Events API. The
emitter is active only when `enabled = true`; access-log emission is not wired.

### `[tinybird]`

| Field                  | Type           | Default                | Contract                                                           |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `enabled`              | Boolean        | `false`                | Enable auction telemetry                                           |
| `api_host`             | String         | `""`                   | Required when enabled; regional host without scheme, port, or path |
| `auction_dataset`      | String         | `"auction_events_raw"` | 1–128 ASCII letters, digits, or `_`                                |
| `auction_token_secret` | String or null | `null`                 | Store key required when enabled; resolved value must be nonempty   |
| `access_enabled`       | Boolean        | `false`                | Reserved; `true` fails startup because no emitter is wired         |
| `access_dataset`       | String         | `"access_logs_raw"`    | Reserved access-log dataset name                                   |
| `access_sample_rate`   | Number         | `0.0`                  | `0.0..=1.0`; reserved while access emission is disabled            |
| `max_body_bytes`       | Integer        | `1048576`              | At least `1024` bytes                                              |

`secret_store` and `access_token_secret` are deprecated compatibility inputs.
Both are removed during normalization; neither reaches runtime or serialized
output. New configurations use only `auction_token_secret`, whose value is
resolved through `trusted_server_secrets`.

The complete enabled example appears in
[Tinybird auction telemetry](#tinybird-auction-telemetry).

## Cache Configuration

Static and rehosted asset cache upgrades are operator-controlled. By default,
Trusted Server leaves arbitrary publisher-origin assets under origin cache
control. Add `[[cache.asset_rules]]` entries only for paths that are known to be
content-addressed or otherwise safe for the configured TTL.

### `[[cache.asset_rules]]`

Rules are evaluated in file order; the first enabled matching rule wins.
Disabled rules never match, and their matcher and policy validation is deferred
until they are enabled. Rule IDs are always normalized and must remain nonempty
and unique, including for disabled placeholders.

| Field                            | Type          | Required | Description                                                                        |

| `visibility`                     | String        | No       | `public` or `private` (default `public`)                                           |

| `stale_while_revalidate_seconds` | Integer       | No       | Optional `stale-while-revalidate`                                                  |
| `stale_if_error_seconds`         | Integer       | No       | Optional `stale-if-error`                                                          |

An enabled rule must configure exactly one matcher. Public rules must configure
at least one of `browser_ttl_seconds` or `edge_ttl_seconds`; private rules must
configure `browser_ttl_seconds` and must not configure `edge_ttl_seconds`.
`path_glob` and `path_globs` are mutually exclusive. `immutable = true`
additionally requires a positive browser TTL and either the content-addressed
`nextjs-static` preset, `hex`, or `esbuild-base32`.

The filename fingerprint check examines the suffix immediately before the final
extension and requires a nonempty filename prefix separated by `.`, `-`, `_`,
or `~`. The accepted immutable conventions are:

- `hex`: hexadecimal suffixes of at least eight characters containing a letter,
  such as `app.0123abcd.js`;
- `esbuild-base32`: eight-character uppercase Base32 suffixes, such as
  `app-VRTVD5R5.js`.

`vite-base64-url` remains available for non-immutable cache rules, but it cannot
prove content addressing. Ordinary names such as `hero-Portrait.jpg` can match
its eight-character Base64URL shape. A matching rule whose selected fingerprint
style fails emits a debug log with the rule ID and rejected path.

Glob patterns are case-sensitive. `*` matches within a single path component,
while `**` matches recursively: `/assets/*.js` matches `/assets/app.js` but not
`/assets/vendor/app.js`; `/assets/**/*.js` matches both.

**Next.js preset example** (disabled until the publisher confirms
`/_next/static/` is content-addressed):

```toml
[[cache.asset_rules]]
id = "nextjs-static"
enabled = false
preset = "nextjs-static"
visibility = "public"
browser_ttl_seconds = 31536000
edge_ttl_seconds = 31536000
immutable = true
```

**Publisher allowlist example** (enable only for an unambiguous immutable
filename convention):

```toml
[[cache.asset_rules]]
id = "publisher-fingerprinted-assets"
enabled = false
path_globs = [
  "/assets/**/*.js",
  "/assets/**/*.css",
  "/assets/**/*.png",
  "/assets/**/*.webp",
]
fingerprint_style = "hex"
visibility = "public"
browser_ttl_seconds = 31536000
edge_ttl_seconds = 31536000
immutable = true
```

If `[cache]` is omitted or no enabled rule matches, Trusted Server preserves the
origin cache policy for publisher-origin assets. On the publisher pass-through
path, an origin `private` or `no-store` directive vetoes a matching rule. Other
origin cache directives, including `no-cache`, are replaced by the configured
policy. `Vary` is preserved, so do not assign a public immutable rule to paths
that vary by cookies or other user-specific request state.

On a configured Fastly asset-rehost route, a matching rule is authoritative
over the third-party origin's cache defaults, including `no-store`, because
Trusted Server owns the rehosted copy. A later Trusted Server or operator-applied
`private` or `no-store` directive still vetoes public policy reapplication and
removes shared-cache headers.

TS-owned validated hash URLs such as `/static/tsjs=...js?v=<hash>` use their
built-in cache policy and do not require an asset rule. Shared-cache keys for
`/static/tsjs=` must preserve `v`; otherwise a matching immutable response can
collide with the missing or mismatched version's short-TTL response.

`edge_ttl_seconds` only emits the selected runtime's shared-cache directive for
public rules. The runtime or service must also enable and consume that
directive. The checked-in Cloudflare manifests intentionally do not enable
Workers Cache: the Worker serves the full publisher gateway, not an isolated
static-only entrypoint. Emitting `Cloudflare-CDN-Cache-Control` alone must not
be treated as permission to cache every response. Any future Workers Cache
opt-in must isolate or explicitly allowlist cacheable traffic. Fastly synthetic
and final egress responses still require explicit runtime cache integration,
tracked in [#908](https://github.com/IABTechLab/trusted-server/issues/908).

## Integration Configurations

`[integration] provider` lists the integrations that run, and each one that has
settings gets its own `[integration.<name>]` table. There is no `enabled` flag,
because an integration that is not on the list does not run. The full rule set
is in [Configuration Rules](/guide/configuration-rules). Every integration that
deploy validation knows is listed below.

### Naming the integrations that run

```toml
[integration]
provider = ["prebid", "gpt", "nextjs"]
```

The integrations this repository ships are `datadome`, `didomi`,
`google_tag_manager`, `gpt`, `gpt_diagnostics`, `js_asset_proxy`, `lockr`,
`nextjs`, `osano`, `permutive`, `prebid`, `sourcepoint` and `testlight`. A
name this build does not have refuses startup, and the message lists the ones
it does. A `[integration.<name>]` table for an integration the list does not
name refuses startup too, so a block left behind after an integration is
switched off is caught rather than sitting unread.

`openrtb`, `prebid_server`, `aps` and `adserver_mock` supply demand and ad
server implementations only. They are not page integrations and cannot be
named here. Their settings live in `[demand.<name>]` and `[adserver.<name>]`.

The sections below cover Prebid, Next.js, Osano, Permutive and Testlight. For
the others, see the relevant integration guides.

### Ad Server Mock Integration

**Section**: `[integration.adserver_mock]`

This integration is the optional auction mediator selected by
`auction.mediator = "adserver_mock"`; it is not an OpenRTB provider.

| Field                  | Type           | Default  | Contract                                          |

| `endpoint`             | URL            | Required | Mediation service URL                             |
| `timeout_ms`           | Integer        | `500`    | `1..=60000` milliseconds                          |
| `price_floor`          | Number or null | `null`   | Optional minimum accepted CPM                     |
| `context_query_params` | Object         | `{}`     | Maps admitted auction-context keys to query names |

### APS Browser Integration

**Section**: `[integration.aps]`

| Field            | Type    | Default            | Contract                               |
| ---------------- | ------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`        | Boolean | `false`            | Enable browser-side APS behavior       |
| `rendering_mode` | String  | `"trusted_server"` | `trusted_server` or `publisher_native` |

Server endpoint, timeout, account, inventory, and debug settings belong to an
`aps` provider and its `profile_config`, not this browser section. See
[APS](/guide/integrations/aps).

### DataDome Integration

**Section**: `[integration.datadome]`

The [DataDome guide](/guide/integrations/datadome) explains request behavior
and exclusion-rule syntax. This table covers every canonical top-level field:

| `inject_client_side_tag`               | Boolean        | `true`                           | Inject only when `client_side_key` is nonempty                  |
| `client_side_tag_url`                  | String         | `/integrations/datadome/tags.js` | Root-relative or HTTPS injection URL                            |

Each `protection_excluded_ip_cidr_sources` item requires `key` and defaults
`config_store` to `datadome-ip-bypass`. Each
`protection_exclusion_rules` item requires `id` (legacy alias `name`), defaults
`enabled` to `true`, defaults `methods` to every method, and selects one typed
matcher: `path_exact`, `path_prefix`, `path_regex`,
`query_param_non_empty`, `asn`, `ip_cidr`, or `ip_cidr_source`.

When `protection_test_bypass` is present, its `enabled` field defaults to
`false`; `credential_secret_name` identifies the secret-store key and becomes
required only when the bypass is enabled. The resolved credential must contain
at least 32 bytes.

The deprecated `server_side_key_secret_store` and nested
`credential_secret_store` inputs are accepted and discarded. Do not add them
to new configurations.

### GPT Diagnostics Integration

**Section**: `[integration.gpt_diagnostics]`

The only field is `enabled`, a Boolean that defaults to `false`. When enabled,
the standalone diagnostics tag is available, but individual browser sessions
still require the activation flow in [GPT diagnostics](/guide/integrations/gpt-diagnostics).

### JS Asset Proxy Integration

**Section**: `[integration.js_asset_proxy]`

Serves explicitly configured third-party JavaScript assets from first-party
paths. Each asset maps one exact publisher-facing path to one exact HTTPS
upstream URL and can independently enable proxying, disable proxying, or block
matching script tags in publisher HTML. There is no dedicated integration
guide; the registered routes appear in the
[API reference](/guide/api-reference#integration-endpoints).

| Field               | Type    | Default | Contract                                      |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`           | Boolean | `false` | Enable asset proxying and HTML rewriting      |
| `cache_ttl_seconds` | Integer | None    | Optional downstream cache TTL for every asset |
| `assets`            | Array   | `[]`    | Asset mappings; required when enabled         |

Each `[[integration.js_asset_proxy.assets]]` entry:

| Field               | Type    | Default   | Contract                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `path`              | String  | Required  | Exact first-party request path served by Trusted Server   |
| `origin_url`        | String  | Required  | Exact upstream JavaScript URL fetched and match-rewritten |
| `proxy`             | String  | `enabled` | `enabled`, `disabled`, or `blocked` (removes script tags) |
| `cache_ttl_seconds` | Integer | None      | Optional per-asset downstream cache TTL override          |

### lockr Integration

**Section**: `[integration.lockr]`

| Field               | Type            | Default                                             | Contract                             |

| `sdk_url`           | URL             | `https://aim.loc.kr/identity-lockr-trust-server.js` | SDK source                           |
| `cache_ttl_seconds` | Integer         | `3600`                                              | `60..=86400` seconds                 |
| `rewrite_sdk`       | Boolean         | `true`                                              | Rewrite matching lockr SDK URLs      |
| `rewrite_sdk_host`  | Boolean or null | `null`                                              | Deprecated compatibility input       |
| `origin_override`   | URL or null     | `null`                                              | Optional upstream `Origin` override  |

See [lockr](/guide/integrations/lockr).

### Prebid Integration

`[integration.prebid]` owns browser behavior only. The server endpoint, the
demand source timeout, routing, debug and test controls, consent forwarding,
bidder-param overrides, and notification suppression belong to a `[demand]`
source with `implementation = "prebid_server"`.

| Browser field                        | Type          | Default                                                                | Description                                                                    |

| `bundle.modules.analytics`           | Array[String] | `[]`                                                                   | Exact analytics module stems used by `ts prebid bundle`                        |

Server-side bidder codes are derived from validated `[auction.bidders.*]`
routes and injected into the browser. There is no second server bidder list in
`[integration.prebid]`. A browser bidder stays client-side only when named in
`client_side_bidders` and its adapter is present in the generated bundle.

**Example**:

```toml
[integration]
provider = ["prebid"]

[integration.prebid]
timeout_ms = 1000
debug = false
client_side_bidders = ["rubicon"]
external_bundle_url = "https://assets.example.com/prebid/trusted-prebid.js"
script_patterns = ["/prebid.js", "/prebid.min.js"]

[[integration.prebid.managed_user_ids]]
name = "sharedId"

[integration.prebid.managed_user_ids.storage]
type = "cookie"
name = "_sharedid"
expires = 15
refresh_in_seconds = 1800

[proxy]
allowed_domains = ["assets.example.com"]

[integration.prebid.bundle.modules]
bidder = ["rubiconBidAdapter"]
user_id = ["sharedIdSystem"]
analytics = ["atsAnalyticsAdapter"]
[demand]
provider = ["pbs_main"]

[demand.pbs_main]
implementation = "prebid_server"
endpoint = "https://prebid.example.com/openrtb2/auction"
routing = "explicit"
debug = false
test_mode = false
consent_forwarding = "both"
bid_param_overrides = { example-server = { placement = "example-placement" } }

[[demand.pbs_main.bid_param_override_rules]]
when.bidder = "example-server"
when.zone = "header"
set = { placement = "example-header-placement" }

[demand.pbs_main.notifications]
suppress_all = false
suppress_seats = ["example-seat"]

[auction.bidders.example-server]
provider = "pbs_main"
```

**Environment override**:

```bash
env 'TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATION__PREBID__TIMEOUT_MS=1000' \
  'TRUSTED_SERVER__DEMAND__PBS_MAIN__DEBUG=true' \
  ts config validate
```

Environment overlays only replace existing scalar leaves. Keep the `provider`
lists, `client_side_bidders`, bidder-parameter overrides and rules in TOML,
then validate and push the edited file.

**Managed User ID modules**:

Each `[[integration.prebid.managed_user_ids]]` entry names a Prebid
`userSync.userIds` module that Trusted Server installs on the page and
reinstates whenever publisher JavaScript replaces the User ID configuration.
Trusted Server does not interpret module-specific fields; every registered
module uses the same vendor-neutral surface. The managed `name` must match a
`configNames` entry in the checked-in `user_id_modules.json` registry:

| Field                        | Type    | Default                        | Description                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`                       | String  | Required                       | Prebid `userSync.userIds` entry name, for example `sharedId`. Unique across entries  |
| `params`                     | Table   | `{}`                           | Module-specific parameters, forwarded to Prebid unchanged                            |
| `storage.type`               | String  | `cookie`                       | Browser storage: `cookie` or `html5`                                                 |
| `storage.name`               | String  | Required when `storage` exists | Cookie or local-storage key the module reads and writes                              |
| `storage.expires`            | Integer | Prebid's own default           | Storage lifetime in days; must be at least 1. Any per-module ceiling is the module's |
| `storage.refresh_in_seconds` | Integer | Prebid's own default           | Seconds before the module may refresh the stored value; must be at least 1           |

The module must be present in the built bundle. Name it under
`[integration.prebid.bundle.modules].user_id`, or omit that list to take the
generator's default preset. `ts prebid bundle` resolves each managed `name`
through the checked-in `user_id_modules.json` registry, rejects unknown names,
ambiguous names, and two names that resolve to the same module, and confirms the
required modules in the newly generated
manifest. A failure identifies the managed name or required module and does not
update the configured bundle hash or SRI. The browser diagnostic remains a
fallback for externally hosted, stale, or modified bundles. Trusted Server core
does not interpret module-specific `params`; it forwards them to Prebid.js
unchanged.

Persisting a resolved ID into the Edge Cookie identity graph additionally
requires a matching `[[ec.partners]]` entry whose `source_domain` equals the
module's OpenRTB EID source.

`managed_user_ids` is an array of tables, so it cannot be set through a
`TRUSTED_SERVER__` environment variable; the scalar overlay only replaces leaves
the published TOML already declares. See
[Managed User ID modules](/guide/integrations/prebid#managed-user-id-modules)
for consent, timing, privacy, degraded behavior, and validation guidance.

**Script Pattern Matching**:

The `script_patterns` configuration determines which Prebid scripts are intercepted and replaced with empty JavaScript responses. This prevents client-side Prebid.js from loading when using server-side bidding.

- **Suffix matching**: `/prebid.min.js` matches any URL ending with that path
- **Wildcard patterns**: `/static/prebid/*` matches paths under that prefix
- **Disable interception**: Set `script_patterns = []` to keep client-side Prebid

See [Prebid Integration](/guide/integrations/prebid) for full details.

**Server Bid Param Override Surfaces**:

These fields belong in the `[demand.<name>]` table of a `prebid_server`
demand source:

- `bid_param_overrides`: static per-bidder shallow-merge overrides;
- `bid_param_zone_overrides`: per-bidder, per-zone shallow-merge overrides; and
- `bid_param_override_rules`: canonical ordered rules with `when` matchers and
  `set` objects.

Compatibility-shaped fields are normalized into the same runtime engine.
Explicit rules run after compatibility-derived rules, so later rules win on
conflicts.

### Next.js Integration

**Section**: `[integration.nextjs]`

| Field                        | Type          | Default                   | Contract                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `rewrite_attributes`         | Array[String] | `["href", "link", "url"]` | Nonempty set of structured payload keys to rewrite |
| `max_combined_payload_bytes` | Integer       | `10485760`                | Maximum combined RSC payload size in bytes         |

**Example**:

```toml
[integration]
provider = ["nextjs"]

[integration.nextjs]
rewrite_attributes = ["href", "link", "url", "src"]
max_combined_payload_bytes = 10485760
```

**Environment Override**:

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATION__NEXTJS__MAX_COMBINED_PAYLOAD_BYTES=10485760
```

Edit `rewrite_attributes` in TOML because the overlay cannot replace arrays.

### Osano Integration

**Section**: `[integration.osano]`

Osano has nothing to set, so naming it in `[integration] provider` is the whole
configuration and it needs no table.

**Example**:

```toml
[integration]
provider = ["osano"]
```

The Osano mirror runs in the browser, so consent cookies it writes are available to Trusted Server on requests after the page where Osano consent APIs become ready. See [Osano Integration](/guide/integrations/osano) for details.

| ----------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `endpoint`        | URL     | Required                           | Testlight auction endpoint          |

[integration.testlight]
endpoint = "https://testlight.example/openrtb2/auction"

```

## Auction Configuration

An auction is configured by three tables. `[demand]` selects the demand sources
and gives each its settings, `[adserver]` selects the ad server that picks the
winner, and `[auction]` holds the settings that belong to the auction itself,
including `[auction.bidders.<code>]`, the only client-visible bidder route map.
`[auction]` is not a provider type and takes no `provider` key.

### `[auction]`

| Field                  | Type    | Default            | Description                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enabled`              | Boolean | `false`            | Enable the auction orchestrator                                |
| `sanitize_creatives`   | Boolean | `false`            | Strip executable markup from winning-bid `adm` before delivery |
| `rewrite_creatives`    | Boolean | `true`             | Rewrite winning-bid `adm` through first-party endpoints        |
| `timeout_ms`           | Integer | `2000`             | Logical auction budget in milliseconds                         |
| `creative_store`       | String  | `"creative_store"` | Deprecated, because creatives are delivered inline             |
| `allowed_context_keys` | Array   | `[]`               | Request context keys admitted into the auction                 |

Creative markup delivered by `POST /auction` and the publisher SSAT/page-bids
path is processed by two independent passes. With `sanitize_creatives = true`
(opt-in, default `false`), executable markup (`script`/`object`/`embed`/`form`
and event handlers) is stripped together with its inner content. This blanks
script-based creatives, so enable it only when creatives render in a context
that shares the publisher's origin. With `rewrite_creatives = true` (the
default), eligible absolute or protocol-relative resource and click URLs not
excluded by rewrite configuration are converted to signed first-party
endpoints, and any bidder-supplied `<base>` element is removed. The
`POST /auction` path emits root-relative endpoints and injects the creative TSJS
runtime exactly once, whether or not the bidder supplied a `<body>`, since bare
fragments are the common `adm` shape. The foreign-origin SSAT renderer emits
absolute endpoints and does not inject that bundle. With both disabled, `adm`
ships exactly as the bidder returned it, except that a creative larger than the
1 MiB per-creative cap is rejected in every mode and its `adm` is dropped.
Accepted external URLs are not host allowlisted by the sanitizer. Neither
setting affects HTML or CSS fetched through `/first-party/proxy`. See
[Creative Processing](/guide/creative-processing#auction-rewrite-control).

::: warning Existing configs, upgrade sequencing, and rollback
Default values are omitted from stored JSON. Non-default values
(`sanitize_creatives = true`, `rewrite_creatives = false`) are serialized, and
older `AuctionConfig` schemas reject unknown fields.

**Upgrading:** binaries that predate `sanitize_creatives` reject a blob that
carries it, so in a rolling deployment upgrade the binary **first**, then push
a config with `sanitize_creatives = true` if you want sanitization. Between the
binary upgrade and the config push, sanitization is off (the new default).
During that interval the creative iframe sandbox is the only isolation for
`/auction` markup. There is no mixed-version-safe value that keeps the old
unconditional sanitization: omission means "sanitize" on old code and "don't"
on new code, while an explicit `true` fails startup on old code.

**Rolling back:** before reverting to a binary that does not know a field,
remove that field's non-default value (and any environment override), run
`ts config validate`, push the resulting default-compatible blob, and only then
roll back the binary.

**Environment overlays:** The pinned EdgeZero loader cannot create missing TOML
leaves. Existing configs must add **both** leaves under `[auction]`
(`rewrite_creatives` and `sanitize_creatives`) before
`TRUSTED_SERVER__AUCTION__REWRITE_CREATIVES` /
`TRUSTED_SERVER__AUCTION__SANITIZE_CREATIVES` can take effect. An override for a
missing leaf is silently ignored.
:::

### Demand sources

::: danger Breaking migration from `[auction.providers]`
`[auction] providers` and `[auction.providers.<id>]` are gone, and a
configuration still carrying either is refused with a message naming where the
setting moved to. Server-owned fields under `[integrations.prebid]` and
`[integrations.aps]` are gone with them.

Move each provider to a `[demand.<name>]` table. `protocol` disappears,
because every implementation states its own wire format. `profile` becomes
`implementation`, so `"standard"` becomes `"openrtb"`, `"prebid-server"`
becomes `"prebid_server"`, and `"aps"` stays `"aps"`. Everything that was
inside `profile_config` moves up into the table itself, flat beside
`endpoint`, `timeout_ms`, `routing` and `notifications`. Provider IDs that
carried a hyphen, such as `pbs-main`, become snake_case, such as `pbs_main`,
and so does every `[auction.bidders.<code>] provider` value that points at
one.

For Prebid Server, move `server_url` to `endpoint` and the server timeout to
`timeout_ms`. Origin-only legacy `server_url` values compile to
`/openrtb2/auction`, query parameters survive, and configured non-root custom
endpoint paths remain exact. Browser timeout, debug, bundle, script
interception, refresh exclusions and `client_side_bidders` stay under
`[integration.prebid]`. Configure timeout or debug under both owners when both
browser and server behavior should retain the old value.

For APS, move the endpoint and timeout to the table, then move account,
inventory, debug and creative controls up beside them. `rendering_mode` moves
out of `[integrations.aps]` into the same table.

Only bidder codes listed in `[auction.bidders]` are folded into Trusted Server
requests. Unlisted publisher bids remain native browser demand.

The old and new blobs are mutually incompatible. Activate the new binary and
the new-shape config together. A binary-first or config-first rolling
deployment will put one version on a schema it rejects. Roll back by restoring
the old binary and old-schema blob together.
:::

`[demand] provider` lists the demand sources, in a list because several run.
Each table name is the demand source's identity for configuration, backend
correlation, health, response metadata and telemetry, and must be snake_case.
The name is the implementation unless the table carries an `implementation`
line, which is how two Prebid Servers run side by side under names of their
own.

**Example**:

```toml
[auction]
enabled = true
sanitize_creatives = false
rewrite_creatives = true
timeout_ms = 2000

[demand]
provider = ["pbs_main", "aps_main"]

[demand.pbs_main]
implementation = "prebid_server"
endpoint = "https://prebid.example.com/openrtb2/auction"
routing = "explicit"
timeout_ms = 1200
debug = false
test_mode = false
consent_forwarding = "both"

[demand.pbs_main.notifications]
suppress_all = false
suppress_seats = ["example-seat"]

[demand.aps_main]
implementation = "aps"
endpoint = "https://aps.example.com/e/pb/bid"
routing = "all_eligible"
account_id = "example-aps-account"
debug = false
allow_script_creatives = false

[auction.bidders.example-server]
provider = "pbs_main"

[adserver]
provider = "adserver_mock"

[adserver.adserver_mock]
endpoint = "https://adserver.example.com/decide"
timeout_ms = 500
```

Every `[demand.<name>]` table takes these four settings, whichever
implementation it names:

| Setting         | Required | Default                | Description                                                                                                                     |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `endpoint`      | Yes      | None                   | Absolute HTTPS URL with a host and no credentials or fragment. Plain HTTP is accepted only to `127.0.0.1`, `::1` or `localhost` |
| `timeout_ms`    | No       | Implementation default | This source's logical budget before the remaining-auction cap                                                                   |
| `routing`       | No       | `explicit`             | `explicit`, or `all_eligible` where the implementation allows it                                                                |
| `notifications` | No       | No suppression         | Common `nurl`/`burl` suppression after response normalization                                                                   |

Every other key in the table belongs to the implementation, which rejects any
key it does not know.

| Implementation  | Default timeout    | `all_eligible` | Its own settings                                                                                                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------ | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `openrtb`       | the auction budget | yes            | `request_ext`, `imp_ext`                                                                                                                        |
| `prebid_server` | 1000 ms            | no             | `debug`, `test_mode`, `debug_query_params`, `consent_forwarding`, `bid_param_overrides`, `bid_param_zone_overrides`, `bid_param_override_rules` |
| `aps`           | 800 ms             | yes            | `account_id` (required), `debug`, `allow_script_creatives`, `inventory_domain`, `inventory_page_origin`, `rendering_mode`                       |

An explicit `timeout_ms` overrides the implementation default. Runtime uses
`min(source timeout, auction time remaining)` for launch decisions and OpenRTB
`tmax`.

`routing = "explicit"` sends only slots carrying a bidder assigned to that
source, plus trusted stored-request routes. `routing = "all_eligible"` sends
every banner-compatible slot to the source, regardless of bidder routes. It
does not disclose bidder parameters assigned to another source. APS commonly
uses `all_eligible` to preserve its whole-inventory participation. The
`prebid_server` implementation rejects `all_eligible` because every PBS
impression must carry routed bidder or stored-request demand.

APS `rendering_mode` is `trusted_server` by default, which renders through
Trusted Server's opaque static renderer route. Set `publisher_native` only for
a controlled publisher-origin friendly-frame cohort.

### Ad server

`[adserver] provider` names the one ad server that picks the winner, as a
string rather than a list, and `[adserver.<name>]` holds its settings. With no
ad server the orchestrator selects the highest decoded CPM per slot and
applies floors locally. With one configured, normalized demand responses are
sent to it, and Trusted Server falls back to local ranking when the ad server
cannot run.

The one implementation this repository ships is `adserver_mock`, for
development and testing.

| Setting                | Required | Default | Description                                                         |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `endpoint`             | Yes      | None    | Decision endpoint URL, on the same scheme rule as a demand endpoint |
| `timeout_ms`           | No       | `500`   | Request timeout, 1 to 60000                                         |
| `price_floor`          | No       | None    | Minimum acceptable CPM                                              |
| `context_query_params` | No       | `{}`    | Maps auction context keys to decision-URL query parameters          |

```toml
[adserver]
provider = "adserver_mock"

[adserver.adserver_mock]
endpoint = "https://adserver.example.com/decide"
timeout_ms = 500

[adserver.adserver_mock.context_query_params]
example_segments = "segments"
```

The word mediator is gone. It is "ad server" in prose and `adserver` in
configuration, `[debug.auction_html_comment_options] include_mediator_response`
is now `include_adserver_response`, and the auction response metadata that read
`parallel_mediation` now reads `parallel_adserver`.

### Bidder routes and bounds

Each `[auction.bidders.<bidder-id>]` maps one client-visible bidder ID to
exactly one demand source, named by its `[demand]` table name. A route naming
a source `[demand] provider` does not select is refused. Bidder IDs must be
nonempty, no more than 128 UTF-8 bytes, contain no control characters or
surrounding whitespace, and cannot be the reserved exact ID `trustedServer`.
Browser `trustedServer.bidderParams` accepts at most 128 bidder entries, and
its optional `zone` is at most 256 UTF-8 bytes.

For the `openrtb` implementation, `request_ext` and `imp_ext` must be JSON
objects. Each object is limited to 16 KiB serialized, eight container levels,
and 256 keys at any one object level. Reserved driver, implementation and
signing fields cannot be overwritten.

Common notification suppression uses exact returned OpenRTB seat values, not
bidder route IDs:

```toml
[demand.pbs_main.notifications]
suppress_all = false
suppress_seats = ["example-seat"]
```

`suppress_seats` permits at most 128 unique nonempty entries, each at most 128
UTF-8 bytes and without ASCII control characters.

### Validation timing and target limits

`ts config validate` and ordinary deploy validation compile the complete
target-independent plan from `[demand]`, `[adserver]` and `[auction.bidders]`.
That covers unselected tables, names that are not snake_case, an
implementation this build does not have, endpoint scheme and host, timeouts,
routing modes, notification bounds, bidder route ownership, signing structure,
and any setting the chosen implementation rejects. Target-specific checks are
deferred to adapter startup. Startup uses the same compiled plan and
additionally validates backend-name prediction and collisions, and demand
fan-out capability.

Fastly and Axum support several configured demand sources. Cloudflare and Spin
currently reject an enabled auction with more than one, because those adapters
do not support concurrent fan-out. A disabled auction may keep a dormant
multi-source plan without target rejection.

A target-aware pre-write `ts config push --adapter <target>` callback is **not
available in this tree** because the required EdgeZero callback is not yet
available. Until it lands, push performs target-independent validation and
adapter startup is the mandatory target-aware gate. Do not treat a successful
push as proof that a Cloudflare or Spin multi-source plan can start.

### Deadline behavior

Configured timeouts are logical budgets, not hard wall-clock guarantees. No
current adapter claims an abortable total-request deadline across demand
sources. Already-launched work may complete after the logical budget and a
completed late response can remain eligible. Once the logical auction budget is
exhausted, Trusted Server starts no additional demand or ad server network
work, then finishes local decision and delivery. An auction can therefore
exceed its configured wall-clock timeout.

Creative sanitization is opt-in. `sanitize_creatives = true` strips executable
markup before delivery. `rewrite_creatives = false` skips first-party URL
rewriting and creative TSJS injection. See
[Creative Processing](/guide/creative-processing#auction-rewrite-control).

**Environment overrides** replace scalar leaves that already exist in TOML:

```bash
env 'TRUSTED_SERVER__AUCTION__ENABLED=true' \
  'TRUSTED_SERVER__AUCTION__SANITIZE_CREATIVES=false' \
  'TRUSTED_SERVER__AUCTION__REWRITE_CREATIVES=true' \
  'TRUSTED_SERVER__AUCTION__TIMEOUT_MS=2000' \
  'TRUSTED_SERVER__DEMAND__PBS_MAIN__ENDPOINT=https://prebid.example.com/openrtb2/auction' \
  'TRUSTED_SERVER__DEMAND__PBS_MAIN__TIMEOUT_MS=900' \
  ts config validate
```

A `provider` list is an array, so `[demand] provider` and
`[integration] provider` cannot be changed by an overlay. Edit the TOML, then
validate and push.

## Creative Opportunities Configuration

### `[creative_opportunities]`

Defines the ad slots the trusted server offers on a page: which pages each slot
appears on (`page_patterns`), its supported sizes (`formats`), and the GAM ad
unit it maps to (`gam_unit_path`).

`enabled` is the dedicated server-side ad-template switch. It defaults to `true`
for compatibility with existing configurations. Set it to `false` to stop
publisher HTML and SPA page-bids template delivery while retaining the slot
configuration and direct `POST /auction` endpoint.

#### Publisher document cache policy

For a successful GET publisher document, Trusted Server applies the
browser-only `Cache-Control: private, max-age=60` policy from
[#1007](https://github.com/IABTechLab/trusted-server/issues/1007) when the
server-side ad stack is structurally inactive. Trusted Server also applies this
policy to a subsequent `304 Not Modified` response so revalidation cannot
restore the origin freshness policy. This includes an absent
`[creative_opportunities]` section, `enabled = false`, no slot matching the
path, or a disabled auction. The `private` directive prevents shared caches
that use `Cache-Control` from storing the document. The policy replaces the
origin browser cache policy except when the origin sends `private` or
`no-store`, which are preserved. Bot, prefetch, and consent-denied requests
also retain the origin policy because they can produce a request-specific
representation for the same URL. Error responses and non-document requests
retain the origin policy.

Trusted Server leaves origin validators and CDN-specific cache headers
unchanged. Those headers continue to control supporting CDNs independently of
the browser-only policy. If a response using the generated inactive-stack
policy later carries `Set-Cookie`, cookie privacy finalization replaces it with
`Cache-Control: private, max-age=0` and removes the CDN-specific cache headers.

```toml
[creative_opportunities]
enabled = true # set to false to disable server-side ad templates
gam_network_id = "123456789"
price_granularity = "dense"

# Shared placeholder value for the site root ("/"). See {section} below.
section_root = "home"
# Which path segment names the section, 0-based. Default 0 (first segment).
# Set to 1 for locale-prefixed URLs such as "/en/news/article".
# section_segment = 0

[[creative_opportunities.slot]]
id = "ad-header"
gam_unit_path = "/{network_id}/example/{section}"
# List each section landing page as well as its subtree: `/news/*` matches
# `/news/article` but NOT `/news`, because the glob requires the trailing separator.
page_patterns = ["/", "/news", "/news/*", "/reviews", "/reviews/*"]
formats = [{ width = 728, height = 90 }]
```

The same switch can be overridden through the typed CLI environment overlay.
Because EdgeZero only replaces TOML leaves that already exist, first add
`enabled = true` to the `[creative_opportunities]` block in the base config
before using this override. See [Environment Variable Overrides (Typed
CLI)](#environment-variable-overrides-typed-cli) for the general overlay rules.

```bash
TRUSTED_SERVER__CREATIVE_OPPORTUNITIES__ENABLED=false
```

> [!WARNING]
> Setting `enabled = false` writes this field into the pushed configuration blob.
> Binaries released before this setting reject the unknown field and fail to load
> settings, which makes every request fail. Before rolling back to an older binary,
> restore `enabled` to its default, re-push and finalize the configuration, then
> roll back the binary.

### Shared template assembly (`assembly_mode = "esi"`)

This configuration is an experimental validation spike scoped to
[IABTechLab/trusted-server#1009](https://github.com/IABTechLab/trusted-server/issues/1009),
not a settled production cache interface.

`assembly_mode` controls how initial-page slot and bid state is delivered:

- `inline` (default) transforms every origin response and injects the current
  reader's slots and bids directly.
- `esi` opts into a reader-neutral transformed-template cache on Fastly. The
  cache stores identity bytes containing one inert, versioned comment. On an
  authorized cold miss, Fastly replaces that comment in a private working copy
  with one synthetic ESI include and resolves it from the already-built reader
  state using the pinned `stackpop/esi` parser. No HTTP fragment request occurs.
  Warm hits use an exact byte split instead, preserving the fast article-prefix
  stream while the auction finishes.

This is deliberately not general publisher-controlled ESI. A transformed origin
document containing any `<esi:` directive bypasses the template cache and the parser, while the
ordinary byte seam still produces the reader's complete response. The stored shared template
object never contains executable ESI markup.

Only Fastly currently supplies the Core Cache backend used by the shared template cache. Other adapters accept
the mode but safely fall back to the inline transform on every request. This is
not a top-level HTTP cache hit: Compute still runs and the final assembled
response is always `Cache-Control: private, no-store`.

All keys below belong directly under `[creative_opportunities]`. They are
one feature contract: `assembly_mode` selects how creative-opportunity state is
delivered, while the other keys constrain when and how long that mode may share
its template.
They are not a general top-level HTTP-cache configuration.

```toml
[creative_opportunities]
assembly_mode = "esi"

# Every request header, except Accept-Encoding, that the publisher origin can
# name in Vary for these documents. Names are validated and de-duplicated.
template_cache_vary = [
  "rsc",
  "next-router-state-tree",
  "next-router-prefetch",
  "next-router-segment-prefetch",
]

# Safety ceiling for the shared template. Defaults to 60; valid range 1–86400.
# The origin's remaining edge freshness may make the actual lifetime shorter.
template_cache_max_age_seconds = 1200

# Optional bounded variant and personal-session policies; omitted means empty.
template_cache_key_cookies = ["ab_bucket"]
template_cache_bypass_cookies = ["session"]

# Default false. With the lists above, false still bypasses every request that
# carries any other cookie, including the TS identity cookie. Set true only
# after proving those unlisted cookies do not change origin HTML.
origin_is_cookie_independent = false
```

The cache fails closed. A template is stored only for a `GET` with a processable
`200 text/html` origin response, a supported content encoding, and explicit
positive shared freshness. `private`, `no-store`, `no-cache`, exhausted or
malformed freshness, `Set-Cookie`, `Vary: *`, `Vary: Cookie`, uncovered `Vary`
names, response-bound CSP nonces, pass-through or ambiguous authorization,
diagnostics sessions, range or conditional requests, positive or malformed
request `max-age`, `min-fresh`, and unsupported CDN-specific cache policy fields
all bypass the template cache. Fastly
`Surrogate-Control` is the narrow exception: the template cache accepts exactly one positive
`max-age` plus optional valid `stale-while-revalidate` and `stale-if-error`
delta-seconds. Restrictive, duplicated, malformed, or unknown directives fail
closed. Stale windows never extend template-cache freshness. Freshness follows Fastly edge
precedence: `Surrogate-Control: max-age`, then `Cache-Control: s-maxage`,
`Cache-Control: max-age`, then `Expires`. Restrictive directives in either policy
still refuse sharing. Origin `Age` and apparent age from `Date` are deducted, time
spent transforming the page continues consuming freshness, and the remaining
lifetime is capped by `template_cache_max_age_seconds`.

A browser reload commonly sends `Cache-Control: max-age=0`. TS may reuse a fresh
reader-neutral shared template for that reload, but it still builds a new private
response and runs a new per-reader auction. Explicit `no-cache`, `no-store`,
positive or malformed request `max-age`, range, and conditional requests still bypass the template cache.
Check `X-TS-Template-Cache: hit` to verify template reuse.

Authorization has one narrow exception. A request carrying exactly the same
single Basic credential that Trusted Server just validated at the edge may share
a template; pass-through, repeated, appended, or replaced values still bypass.
Trusted Server does not remove the validated header, so it remains forwarded to
the publisher origin. If the origin uses that credential to select response
content, it must declare `Vary: Authorization`; that response is deliberately not
stored as a shared template.

`template_cache_vary` is necessary because lookup occurs before the origin can
return `Vary`. Presence, empty values, repeated raw field values, host/scheme,
origin identity, complete template-shaping settings, TSJS content, and schema
version all participate in an opaque SHA-256 cache key. `Accept-Encoding` does
not: the stored template is decoded identity and the assembled result is encoded
for each reader with `Vary: Accept-Encoding`. This assumes the origin's
`Accept-Encoding` variants differ only by HTTP content coding, as normal
compression negotiation does. Do not enable ESI for an origin that changes the
document's meaning based on `Accept-Encoding`. Never put `Cookie` or
`Authorization` in `template_cache_vary`; startup rejects both because raw cookie
or credential values are not reader-neutral template dimensions. An origin
`Vary: Cookie` always refuses storage, including when a named cookie policy is
configured or `origin_is_cookie_independent` is `true`.
Every other name the origin emits in `Vary`
must appear in the configured list; an uncovered name safely refuses template
storage.

The optional cookie lists control both template lookup and storage:

- `template_cache_key_cookies` includes each named cookie's presence and value in
  the template key. Use bounded, reader-neutral variants such as experiment arms
  or region buckets, never account IDs, session tokens, or TS identity IDs. Missing
  and empty values select different variants. Multiple names form a combined variant.
- `template_cache_bypass_cookies` forces inline processing whenever any named
  cookie is present, including an empty value such as `session=`. This applies
  regardless of the independence assertion or any key cookies in the request.
- When either list is nonempty, `origin_is_cookie_independent` applies only to
  unlisted cookies. The safe default, `false`, bypasses requests containing any
  unlisted cookie; `true` asserts that those cookies do not change origin HTML.
  TS identity and consent cookies have no implicit exception.
- When both lists are omitted or empty, the existing all-cookie behavior remains:
  `false` bypasses every request carrying a `Cookie` header; `true` asserts that
  all cookies are irrelevant to origin HTML.

Cookie names match exactly and case-sensitively: `session` and `Session` are
different names. Use nonempty ASCII HTTP token names; whitespace, `;`, `=`, and
non-ASCII characters are invalid. Configuration rejects invalid names, duplicates
within a list, overlap between lists, and TS identity cookies (`ts-ec`, `ts-eids`,
`sharedId`) in the key list. Identity cookies may be listed for bypass. Wildcards,
prefixes, and regular expressions are not supported. With either list nonempty, parsing of all
`Cookie` fields after existing request preparation bypasses duplicate key-cookie names,
invalid names, and malformed key-cookie values. When independence is `true`,
duplicate unlisted names are allowed if every value passes framing checks, and
unlisted values may also contain commas and balanced double quotes, supporting
compact JSON cookies such as `g_state` and comma-separated experiment metadata.
Unmatched quotes, whitespace within values, backslashes, controls, non-ASCII bytes,
and comma-separated fragments resembling another `name=value` cookie still bypass.
The origin must parse semicolon-separated cookies independently and treat these
unlisted values as opaque. If its parser stops at a nonstandard value or changes
how later key cookies are interpreted, the independence assertion is not valid.
Cookies are forwarded unchanged by this policy; their values are not exposed in
cache diagnostics. There is no value allowlist or cardinality limit, so operators
must ensure keyed values stay bounded and account for every origin HTML dependency.

If a downstream CDN translates `ab_bucket=A` into `X-Exp-Variant: A` after the
request passes TS, configure both dimensions:

```toml
[creative_opportunities]
assembly_mode = "esi"
# Retain any other header dimensions required by the origin.
template_cache_vary = ["x-exp-variant"]
template_cache_key_cookies = ["ab_bucket"]
template_cache_bypass_cookies = ["session"]
# Only after verifying that all remaining cookies leave origin HTML unchanged.
origin_is_cookie_independent = true
```

The cookie dimension separates experiment arms at TS even when the header is
absent there; the header dimension covers the origin's `Vary: X-Exp-Variant`.
Configuring the header alone cannot distinguish these readers. TS cannot verify
the downstream mapping or discover other inputs selecting origin HTML. During a
canary, check correct content for each arm, absent and empty experiment values,
and session-bearing requests, as well as cache diagnostics.

The lists can also be used independently within `[creative_opportunities]`. For
experiment-only HTML, omit the bypass list:

```toml
template_cache_vary = ["x-exp-variant"]
template_cache_key_cookies = ["ab_bucket"]
origin_is_cookie_independent = true
```

For anonymous sharing with a logged-in population, omit the key list:

```toml
template_cache_bypass_cookies = ["session"]
origin_is_cookie_independent = true
```

Both examples require the same assertion that unlisted cookies do not change
origin HTML and retain all other ESI eligibility and header-coverage requirements.

For a canary, inspect `X-TS-Template-Cache`. Its bounded values are `hit`,
`miss-stored`, `miss-store-error`, `miss-reserved`, `bypass-request`,
`bypass-response`, `unsupported`, `invalid`, and `backend-error`. No URL, header
value, or cache key is exposed. `invalid` and `backend-error` fail open to a
fresh origin response; they do not fail the page. The corresponding
`template_cache` logs provide server-side observability for this path.

`X-TS-Assembly` identifies how the private response was assembled:

- `esi-parser`, an authorized cold miss assembled by the repaired parser;
- `byte-seam`, a warm template-cache hit using the streaming byte seam;
- `byte-seam-fallback`, a cold response safely assembled by byte seam because
  the platform parser was unavailable or rejected the document.

The two headers together are the reliable verification signal. Timing alone can
vary with the origin, auction, compression, browser connection reuse, and local
proxy buffering.

Rollback must preserve configuration compatibility:

1. Change `assembly_mode` to `inline` and deploy/push that configuration.
2. Before rolling back to a binary that predates these fields, remove
   `assembly_mode`, `template_cache_vary`, `template_cache_max_age_seconds`,
   `template_cache_key_cookies`, `template_cache_bypass_cookies`, and
   `origin_is_cookie_independent`, then push the cleaned configuration. Older binaries
   use `deny_unknown_fields` and intentionally reject unknown keys, even empty lists.
   When rolling back only the named-cookie feature to a binary that supports ESI,
   remove both cookie-list fields and keep `origin_is_cookie_independent = false`
   or disable ESI if the origin depends on cookies. Keeping `true` after removing
   the lists loses variant separation and session bypass.
3. Purge the Fastly surrogate key `ts-template` using the service's normal purge
   tooling, or wait for the bounded origin-derived lifetime to expire.

Run `scripts/template-cache-local-test.sh esi` before a rollout and
`scripts/template-cache-local-test.sh inline` as its control. The harness uses a temporary
manifest, never edits the tracked `fastly.toml`, verifies cold/warm origin
counts and response integrity, and executes the generated GPT module against
the served seam to require a real `defineSlot` call. Both modes also exercise a
cookie-selected origin: A/B isolation without a client variant header, absent
versus empty buckets, ignored compact JSON and comma-list cookies, and session
bypass on warm and cold URLs. Each request checks the selected HTML, cache
diagnostics, private response policy, winning-bid assembly, and origin fetch count.

### `gam_unit_path` templating

`gam_unit_path` is a template. A publisher whose ad unit varies by site section
expresses that in **one** slot rule instead of one rule per (slot × section).

Supported placeholders:

| Placeholder    | Resolves to                                                             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{network_id}` | `gam_network_id`                                                        |
| `{slot_id}`    | the slot's `id`                                                         |
| `{section}`    | non-empty path segment at `section_segment` (default: first; see below) |

A template with **no** placeholders is used verbatim. A slot with **no**
`gam_unit_path` falls back to `/<network_id>/<slot_id>`. Both preserve the
pre-templating behavior, so existing static configs are unchanged.

Trusted Server conservatively caps the whole rendered dynamic path at 100 UTF-8
bytes, informed by Google's [100-character per-ad-unit-code
limit](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/1628457?hl=en). If a
request-specific substitution would exceed the dynamic limit, only that slot is
omitted before auction dispatch; the response itself still succeeds. Trusted
Server logs a warning containing the slot ID and request path. Explicit static
paths and absent/default paths retain legacy behavior and are not subject to this
dynamic-only limit.

### `{section}` derivation

`{section}` is derived from the request path at request time:

- It is the non-empty path segment at `section_segment` (0-based, default `0`).
  With the default, `/news/article-123` → `news`. A site that prefixes a locale
  sets `section_segment = 1`, so `/en/news/article` → `news` rather than `en`.
- It is sanitized: each run of characters outside `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` becomes a
  single `_`, and the request-derived result is capped at 100 ASCII bytes.
- Casing is preserved. [Google documents GAM ad-unit codes as
  case-insensitive](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/10477476?hl=en),
  so do not lowercase the value.
- The path is used **raw, and is not percent-decoded**. So `/new%20s` →
  `new_20s` (only `%` is disallowed; `2` and `0` are kept), never the decoded
  `new_s`. This keeps `{section}` consistent with how `page_patterns` match the
  same raw path.
- When the path has no segment at that index, being the site root (`/`, or
  repeated slashes) or a path shorter than `section_segment`, `{section}` is
  `section_root`. So with `section_segment = 1`, the path `/en` renders the root
  section rather than reusing the locale.

`section_root` is **required** whenever any slot's template uses `{section}`,
and must match `[A-Za-z0-9_-]+`. There is no default: the home-section name is
publisher-specific. Startup fails if `{section}` is used without a valid
`section_root`. Startup rejects a blank `gam_network_id` only when an absent
path/default or a `{network_id}` template consumes it; static paths and
templates without `{network_id}` do not consume it. A
`[creative_opportunities]` block with `enabled = false` or no slots is
inactive, so no publisher templates are delivered and its `gam_network_id` is
not checked when no slot uses it.

Both knobs are config-driven, so the URL→section convention stays with the
publisher: `section_segment` selects which segment names the section, and
`section_root` names the section when there is none.

During typed/startup finalization, after templates parse successfully, every
placeholder-bearing dynamic template that omits `section_segment` has
`section_segment = 0` materialized, so an older binary rejects the pushed blob
loudly. Static and absent paths remain compatible with the legacy config schema
only when both `section_root` and `section_segment` are omitted. Before rolling
back below this feature, replace or remove dynamic paths, remove both
`section_root` and `section_segment`, re-push and finalize the config, then
roll back the binary.

Example resolution for `gam_unit_path = "/{network_id}/example/{section}"` with
`gam_network_id = "123456789"`, `section_root = "home"`, and the
`page_patterns` shown above:

| Request path    | `gam_unit_path`              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `/`             | `/123456789/example/home`    |
| `/news`         | `/123456789/example/news`    |
| `/news/article` | `/123456789/example/news`    |
| `/reviews/x`    | `/123456789/example/reviews` |

The same config with `section_segment = 1` and locale-prefixed patterns
(`["/en", "/en/news", "/en/news/*"]`):

| Request path       | `gam_unit_path`           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `/en`              | `/123456789/example/home` |
| `/en/news`         | `/123456789/example/news` |
| `/en/news/article` | `/123456789/example/news` |

An **unmatched route**, a path matched by no slot's `page_patterns`, produces
no slot at all, so no template is rendered for it.

Startup validation rejects a malformed template: an unknown placeholder (e.g.
`{oops}`), an unmatched or nested `{`, a stray `}`, or an empty `gam_unit_path`.

## Debug Configuration

Every debug switch defaults to `false`. These controls expose request,
auction, TLS, or creative data and are for controlled non-production use only.

### `[debug]`

| Field                                                     | Type          | Default                                | Contract                                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ja4_endpoint_enabled`                                    | Boolean       | `false`                                | Expose `GET /_ts/debug/ja4` on Fastly                            |
| `auction_html_comment`                                    | Boolean       | `false`                                | Insert an auction diagnostic comment before `</body>`            |
| `inject_adm_for_testing`                                  | Boolean       | `false`                                | Enable the direct GAM-replace test path and raw `debug_bid` data |
| `auction_html_comment_options.include_provider_responses` | Boolean       | `true`                                 | Include provider response summaries                              |
| `auction_html_comment_options.include_mediator_response`  | Boolean       | `true`                                 | Include mediator response summaries                              |
| `auction_html_comment_options.include_bids`               | Boolean       | `true`                                 | Include provider bid arrays                                      |
| `auction_html_comment_options.metadata_keys`              | Array[String] | `error_type`, `http_status`, `message` | Must be a subset of this fixed allowlist                         |
| `auction_html_comment_options.verbosity`                  | String        | `"redacted"`                           | `redacted`, `upstream`, or `full`                                |
| `auction_html_comment_options.format`                     | String        | `"compact"`                            | `compact` or `pretty`                                            |

The default options table is omitted from serialized config for rollback
compatibility. A non-default table is serialized and therefore requires every
running binary to understand it. `upstream` and `full` can expose
identity-bearing provider data; `inject_adm_for_testing` carries raw creative
markup. Do not enable them in production.

```toml
[debug]
ja4_endpoint_enabled = false
auction_html_comment = false
inject_adm_for_testing = false
```

## Fastly Runtime Config Store

After the EdgeZero cutover, the Fastly adapter always dispatches through the
EdgeZero entry point. The former `edgezero_enabled` and `edgezero_rollout_pct`
canary keys are no longer read.

The Fastly service must still provide a `trusted_server_config` config store
because the entry point opens it before dispatch and passes the handle to
EdgeZero-backed platform services. The store may be empty unless another feature
adds keys to it.

**Local development** (`fastly.toml`):

```toml
[local_server.config_stores]
  [local_server.config_stores.trusted_server_config]
    format = "inline-toml"
    [local_server.config_stores.trusted_server_config.contents]
```

**Production setup** (Fastly CLI):

```bash
# Create the store once and attach it to the service.
fastly config-store create --name trusted_server_config
```

Rollback to the legacy entry point is no longer controlled by runtime config
keys. Use the normal deployment rollback path to restore a pre-cleanup service
version if that is required.

## Validation

Configuration is checked at two gates.
[Configuration Rules](/guide/configuration-rules#what-is-checked-before-a-request-is-served)
sets out which rule is caught where. In short, `ts config validate`,
`ts config diff` and `ts config push` check everything that can be decided
from the file, and startup checks the rest and runs the first set again.

### Checked when the configuration is validated or pushed

**Publisher**:

- All fields non-empty
- `origin_url` is a valid URL

**EC Validation**:

- `provider`, when set, is `snake_case` and has the `[ec.<name>]` table its
  implementation needs, and no unselected table is left configured, or startup
  fails
- The `hmac.passphrase` key name is non-empty at push time, the resolved
  passphrase is at least 32 bytes at runtime, and a known placeholder value is
  rejected after resolution
- The complete auction plan compiles from `[demand]`, `[adserver]` and
  `[auction.bidders]`, so an unselected table, a name that is not snake_case,
  an implementation this build does not have, a bad endpoint, an out-of-range
  timeout, an unsupported routing mode, a route naming an unselected demand
  source, or a setting the implementation rejects, all fail here

**Secrets**:

- Every secret setting holds a key name and no secret value

**Handlers**:

- `path` is a valid regex
- `username` is ordinary configuration and non-empty
- At least one handler covers the `/_ts/admin` namespace

**Integrations**:

- Each integration validates its own block, selected or not, so a typo in a
  block that is switched off is still caught

### Checked when the service starts

Everything above runs again on the loaded configuration, and these join it:

- The `[ec]`, `[geo]`, `[device]` and `[permission_signal]` selections. A name
  this build does not have, a missing settings table, or a table the selector
  does not name, stops the service on its next start. A passing
  `ts config validate` is not proof that a change to those four will start
- Resolved secret values, so a passphrase shorter than 32 bytes, a placeholder
  or a weak handler password fails here
- The compiled `permissions.yaml` policy, and the `assume_single_jurisdiction`
  acknowledgment an Edge Cookie provider needs when no geo provider is selected
- The checks only the host can make, being backend name prediction and
  collisions, and whether the adapter can call more than one demand source at
  once

### Validation Errors

**Error Format**:

```
Configuration error: [demand.pbs_main] endpoint must be HTTPS, or HTTP to 127.0.0.1, ::1 or localhost, with a host and no credentials or fragment
```

## Best Practices

### Configuration Management

**Development**:

```toml
# trusted-server.dev.toml
[publisher]
domain = "localhost"
origin_url = "http://localhost:3000"
proxy_secret = "publisher_proxy_secret"
```

**Staging and production**:

- Provision the same key names in the target `trusted_server_secrets` store.
- Keep only the key names in `trusted-server.toml` and environment overlays.
- Push the config after provisioning and restart/redeploy after rotation.

### Secret Management

**Do**:

- ✅ Store values in the platform secret store
- ✅ Rotate values deliberately and restart/redeploy instances
- ✅ Generate values locally without printing them to logs
- ✅ Use different values per environment when appropriate
- ✅ Keep stable key names for rotation

**Don't**:

- ❌ Commit secret values to version control
- ❌ Put secret values in environment overlays
- ❌ Put secret values in config diff output or app-config blobs
- ❌ Treat missing secret-store keys as inline values
- ❌ Use default/placeholder values
- ❌ Share secrets across environments
- ❌ Log secret values
- ❌ Expose in error messages

### File Organization

**Recommended Structure**:

```
trusted-server.toml          # Base config
trusted-server.dev.toml      # Development overrides
.env.development             # Dev environment vars
.env.staging                 # Staging environment vars
.env.production              # Production environment vars (not in git)
.env.example                 # Example template (in git)
```

**.gitignore**:

```
.env.production
.env.staging
.env.local
*.secret
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to build configuration"**:

- Check TOML syntax (trailing commas, quotes)
- Verify all required fields present
- Check environment variable format

**"Configuration field '...' is set to a known placeholder value"**:

- Confirm the referenced key exists in `trusted_server_secrets`
- Ensure the resolved value is non-empty and not a known placeholder
- Do not replace the key name with a plaintext value in the app config
- Rotate the value in the platform secret store, then restart/redeploy

**"Invalid regex"**:

- Handler `path` must be valid regex
- Test pattern: `echo "^/_ts/admin" | grep -E "^/_ts/admin"`
- Escape special characters: `\.`, `\$`, etc.

**"Integration configuration could not be parsed"**:

- Check JSON syntax in env vars
- Verify indexed arrays (0, 1, 2...)
- Check field names match exactly

**Environment Variables Not Applied**:

- Run the override through `ts config validate`, `ts config diff`, or `ts config push`
- Verify the target leaf already exists in `trusted-server.toml`; the pinned EdgeZero loader does not create missing fields
- Verify prefix: `TRUSTED_SERVER__`
- Check separator: `__` (double underscore)
- Confirm the variable is exported: `echo $VARIABLE_NAME`
- Rerun `ts config push` after changing a deploy-time override
- Try explicit string: `VARIABLE='value'` not `VARIABLE=value`

### Inspect Configuration Inputs

Runtime adapters load the app-config envelope with
`get_settings_from_config_store` from the `trusted_server_core::settings_data`
module. For a source file or local fixture, use `Settings::from_toml`; there is
no process-global settings accessor.

**Check Environment**:

```bash
# List all TRUSTED_SERVER variables
env | grep TRUSTED_SERVER
```

**Validate TOML**:

```bash
# Use any TOML validator
cat trusted-server.toml | npx toml-cli validate
```
