**Configuration:** Disabled by default. Enable with:

```toml
[tester_cookie]
enabled = true
```

**Response when enabled:**

- **Status:** `204 No Content`
- **Headers:**

```http
Set-Cookie: ts-tester=true; Domain=<publisher.cookie_domain>; Path=/; Secure; SameSite=Lax
Cache-Control: no-store, private
```

The cookie domain comes from `[publisher].cookie_domain`.

**Response when disabled:**

- **Set-Cookie:** none

**Example:**

```bash
curl -i "https://edge.example.com/_ts/set-tester"
```

### GET /\_ts/clear-tester

**Response when enabled:**

- **Status:** `204 No Content`
- **Headers:**

```http
Set-Cookie: ts-tester=; Domain=<publisher.cookie_domain>; Path=/; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Max-Age=0
Cache-Control: no-store, private
```

The cookie domain comes from `[publisher].cookie_domain`.

**Response when disabled:**

- **Status:** `404 Not Found`
- **Set-Cookie:** none

**Example:**

```bash
curl -i "https://edge.example.com/_ts/clear-tester"
```

## First-Party Endpoints

### GET /first-party/ad

Server-side ad rendering endpoint. Returns complete HTML for a single ad slot.

**Query Parameters:**
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `slot` | string | Yes | Ad slot identifier (matches ad unit code) |
| `w` | integer | Yes | Ad width in pixels |
| `h` | integer | Yes | Ad height in pixels |

**Response:**

- **Content-Type:** `text/html; charset=utf-8`
- **Body:** Complete HTML creative with first-party proxying applied

**Example:**

```bash
curl "https://edge.example.com/first-party/ad?slot=header-banner&w=728&h=90"
```

**Response Headers:**

No EC ID response header is emitted. EC identity is maintained with the `ts-ec` cookie.

**Use Cases:**

- Server-side ad rendering
- Direct iframe embedding
- First-party ad delivery

---

## Edge Cookie Endpoints

Partners are configured statically in `[[ec.partners]]` and loaded into an in-memory registry at startup. There is no runtime partner-registration endpoint and the legacy browser pixel sync endpoint has been removed; browser-resolved IDs are ingested through Prebid EID cookies.

---

### GET /\_ts/api/v1/identify

Returns EC identity plus the authenticated partner's UID and EID for the current user.

**Auth:** Bearer token (`Authorization: Bearer <partner-api-key>`)

**Request:**

- Uses `ts-ec` cookie and consent signals

**Response (example):**

```json
{
  "ec": "954d...e0c3.nZ1GxL",
  "consent": "ok",
  "degraded": false,
  "source_domain": "formally-vital-lion.edgecompute.app",
  "uid": "mock-user-123",
  "eid": {
    "source": "formally-vital-lion.edgecompute.app",
    "uids": [{ "id": "mock-user-123", "atype": 3 }]
  },
  "cluster_size": 3
}
```

`uid`, `eid`, and `cluster_size` are optional and omitted when unavailable
(e.g. no partner UID synced yet, KV read degraded, or cluster size not
re-evaluated within the recheck window).

---

### POST /\_ts/api/v1/batch-sync

Server-to-server batch sync endpoint for writing EC ID to partner UID mappings. Mapping timestamps are retained in the request schema for compatibility, but they no longer order writes because EC identity entries do not store per-partner sync timestamps. Valid mappings use idempotent last-write-wins semantics.

**Auth:** Bearer token (`Authorization: Bearer <partner-api-key>`)

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "mappings": [
    {
      "ec_id": "954d8e7398dd993f78e3875ca1ef7841249781240e913157c1f2d6a6c960e0c3.nZ1GxL",
      "partner_uid": "mock-user-123",
      "timestamp": 1775147300
    }
  ]
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "accepted": 1,
  "rejected": 0,
  "errors": []
}
```

---

### POST /\_ts/api/v1/ec/resolve

Resolve endpoint for client-side Edge Cookie providers. The page posts a value that the provider verifies and creates the Edge Cookie value. Used only when a client-side provider is selected (for example the `client-fixed` demo). Server-side providers such as HMAC do not use it.

**Auth:** None, but the request must carry an `Origin` on the publisher's own domain (a foreign or missing `Origin` answers `403`). This is a first-party POST from the page. The provider is responsible for verifying the posted value before trusting it.

**Request Body:** the provider's value, opaque to the core. For the `client-fixed` demo this is the fixed known word sent as `text/plain`.

**Behavior:** gated by the [permission model](/guide/permission-model) exactly like organic generation. On success the identifier is written to the identity graph first, then the EC cookie is set on this response (`HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite=Lax`) together with the `ts-ecr` marker cookie the page script can read, and the status is `200`. When the gate is closed, no client-side provider is configured, no identity graph is available, or the provider produces no identifier, the response is `204` with no cookie. Rejections: `403` for a missing or foreign `Origin`, `415` for a content type other than `text/plain` or `application/json`, `413` for an oversized body, `400` when the created identifier is outside the identifier bounds, `409` when the request already carries a different identity, and `503` when the identity-graph write fails. Every response the handler builds carries `Cache-Control: no-store`.

---

### POST /third-party/ad

Client-side auction endpoint for TSJS library.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "adUnits": [
    {
      "code": "header-banner",
      "mediaTypes": {
        "banner": {
          "sizes": [
            [728, 90],
            [970, 250]
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "config": {
    "debug": false
  }
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "seatbid": [
    {
      "bid": [
        {
          "impid": "header-banner",
          "adm": "<html>...</html>",
          "price": 1.5,
          "w": 728,
          "h": 90
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Example:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://edge.example.com/third-party/ad \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"adUnits":[{"code":"banner","mediaTypes":{"banner":{"sizes":[[300,250]]}}}]}'
```

---

### GET /first-party/proxy

Unified proxy for resources referenced by creatives (images, scripts, CSS, etc.).

**Query Parameters:**
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `tsurl` | string | Yes | Target URL without query parameters (base URL) |
| `tstoken` | string | Yes | Base64 URL-safe SHA-256 digest of encrypted full target URL |
| `*` | any | No | Original target URL query parameters (preserved as-is) |

**Response:**

- **Content-Type:** Mirrors upstream or inferred from content
- **Body:** Proxied resource content
  - HTML responses: Rewritten with creative processor
  - Image responses: Proxied with content-type inference
  - Other: Passed through

**Behavior:**

- Validates `tstoken` against reconstructed URL
- Follows redirects (301/302/303/307/308, max 4 hops)
- Injects EC ID as `ts-ec` query parameter
- Logs 1×1 pixel impressions

**Example:**

```bash
# Original URL: https://ad.doubleclick.net/pixel?id=123&type=view
# Signed proxy URL:
curl "https://edge.example.com/first-party/proxy?tsurl=https://ad.doubleclick.net/pixel&id=123&type=view&tstoken=abc123xyz..."
```

**Error Responses:**

- `400 Bad Request` - Missing or invalid `tstoken`
- `403 Forbidden` - Token validation failed
- `500 Internal Server Error` - Upstream fetch failed

---

### GET /first-party/click

Click tracking redirect endpoint.

**Query Parameters:**
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `tsurl` | string | Yes | Target redirect URL without query parameters |
| `tstoken` | string | Yes | Base64 URL-safe SHA-256 digest of encrypted full target URL |
| `*` | any | No | Original target URL query parameters |

**Response:**

- **Status:** `302 Found`
- **Location:** Reconstructed target URL with EC ID injected

**Behavior:**

- Validates `tstoken` against reconstructed URL
- Injects `ts-ec` query parameter
- Logs click metadata (tsurl, referer, user agent)
- Does not proxy content (redirect only)

**Example:**

```bash
curl -I "https://edge.example.com/first-party/click?tsurl=https://advertiser.com/landing&campaign=123&tstoken=xyz..."
# → 302 Location: https://advertiser.com/landing?campaign=123&ts-ec=abc123
```

---

### GET/POST /first-party/sign

URL signing endpoint. Returns a signed first-party proxy URL for a valid HTTP or HTTPS target. When `proxy.allowed_domains` is non-empty, the endpoint checks the parsed target host before signing. An empty list permits every valid host.

**Request Methods:** GET or POST

**GET Request:**

```bash
curl "https://edge.example.com/first-party/sign?url=https://cdn.example.com/pixel.gif"
```

**POST Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://edge.example.com/first-party/sign \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"https://cdn.example.com/pixel.gif"}'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "href": "/first-party/proxy?tsurl=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.example.com%2Fpixel.gif&tstoken=abc123...&tsexp=1234567890",
  "base": "https://cdn.example.com/pixel.gif"
}
```

`href` is the signed proxy path. `base` is the normalized target without its query or fragment.

**Error Responses:**

- `403 Forbidden`: The target has a valid host that does not match a non-empty `proxy.allowed_domains` list

**Use Cases:**

- TSJS creative runtime (image/iframe proxying)
- Dynamic URL signing in client-side code
- Testing proxy URL generation

---

### POST /first-party/proxy-rebuild

URL mutation recovery endpoint. Re-signs a click URL after creative JavaScript modifies its query parameters. The original `tstoken` is validated first, and `tsurl`, `tstoken`, and `tsexp` can never be added or removed.

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "tsclick": "/first-party/click?tsurl=https%3A%2F%2Fadvertiser.example&campaign=123&tstoken=original...",
  "add": {
    "utm_source": "banner"
  },
  "del": ["old_param"]
}
```

`tsclick` may be root-relative (the form the rewriter emits) or absolute.

**Response:**

```json
{
  "href": "/first-party/click?tsurl=https%3A%2F%2Fadvertiser.example&campaign=123&utm_source=banner&tstoken=new...",
  "base": "https://advertiser.example",
  "added": { "utm_source": "banner" },
  "removed": ["old_param"]
}
```

**Use Cases:**

- TSJS click guard (automatic URL repair) on same-origin pages
- Handling creative JavaScript that modifies tracking URLs

---

### GET /first-party/proxy-rebuild

Navigation form of the same recovery, for creatives rendered in a sandboxed iframe without `allow-same-origin`. Their opaque origin makes the JSON POST a CORS-preflighted cross-origin request that the endpoint does not answer, so the click guard navigates here instead — navigations are not subject to CORS.

**Query Parameters:**

| Parameter | Required | Description                                       |
| --------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `tsclick` | Yes      | URL-encoded signed click URL                      |
| `add`     | No       | URL-encoded JSON object of parameters to add      |
| `del`     | No       | URL-encoded JSON array of parameter names to drop |

**Response:** `302` with the rebuilt `/first-party/click?...` URL in `Location` and `Cache-Control: no-store, private`. The browser follows it to `/first-party/click`, which redirects on to the advertiser.

Validation is identical to the POST form.

**Form-encoded POST (navigation, no URL length limit):** when the GET recovery URL would exceed the platform's request-URL limit (Fastly Compute rejects request URLs over 8192 bytes before the handler runs), the click guard submits a form instead. A `POST` carrying `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` with the same `tsclick`/`add`/`del` fields is treated as a navigation and answered with the same `302`, not the JSON body.

---

## Request Signing Endpoints

**Authentication:** Requires basic auth (configured via `handlers` in `trusted-server.toml`)

**Request Body (Optional):**

```json
{
  "kid": "custom-key-id"
}
```

If omitted, auto-generates date-based ID (e.g., `ts-2025-01-15-A`).

## Admin Diagnostic Endpoints

These endpoints expose sensitive identity and cookie data and require HTTP Basic Authentication. Configure a handler that covers the entire `/_ts/admin` namespace; startup rejects configurations that do not protect every admin route, including handlers that match only some `/_ts/admin/ec/{id}` values — the dynamic route needs a prefix-level matcher such as `^/_ts/admin` or `^/_ts/admin/ec/`. The whole `/_ts/admin` prefix is reserved: any admin path that reaches publisher fallback — unknown, malformed, or percent-encoded (`/_ts/admin%2Fec`) — is answered locally with `404` and is never proxied, so an admin `Authorization` header and request body never reach the publisher origin. The retired non-`/_ts` `/admin/keys` aliases are reserved the same way. Normal diagnostic-handler responses after successful authentication are JSON with `Cache-Control: no-store`. Missing or invalid credentials receive the shared plaintext `401 Unauthorized` Basic-auth challenge. Unexpected configuration or KV failures use the adapter's shared plaintext `5xx` error response. Those authentication and internal-error responses are outside the diagnostic JSON and cache-header contract.

The examples below use fictional IDs and values only.

### GET /\_ts/admin/ec

### GET /\_ts/admin/ec/`{id}`

Reads an EC identity-graph record for troubleshooting. The explicit route accepts an EC ID in `{64 lowercase hex}.{6 alphanumeric}` format, with or without the `hmac~` provider-code prefix a created identifier carries. The bare route uses the request's `ts-ec` cookie.

This lookup is implemented only by the Fastly adapter because the identity graph is stored in Fastly KV. Other adapters return `501 Not Implemented`.

**Response fields:**

- `ec_id`, `store`, and `generation` identify the raw KV lookup.
- `entry` preserves the stored JSON shape, including unknown and legacy fields. Derived `created_iso` and `consent.updated_iso` fields are added only when absent.
- `metadata` preserves the stored metadata JSON shape.
- `tombstone` reports whether consent has been withdrawn. It is absent when the entry body cannot be parsed as JSON or deserialized as the typed EC schema.
- `auction.eids` previews the partner EIDs the stored record can contribute; `auction.skipped` explains filtered IDs.
- `entry_error`, `metadata_error`, and `raw_body` keep malformed or schema-incompatible records inspectable.

The auction preview validates the stored record and partner configuration, but cannot reproduce live per-request consent checks. It must not be treated as proof that a specific auction request will receive those EIDs.

**Status codes:**

| Status | Meaning                                                     |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `200`  | Record found, including inspectable corrupt records         |
| `400`  | Invalid explicit EC ID                                      |
| `401`  | Missing or invalid Basic credentials                        |
| `404`  | Record not found, or the bare route has no `ts-ec` cookie   |
| `405`  | Method other than `GET` (`Allow: GET`)                      |
| `501`  | EC identity graph unavailable on this adapter or deployment |
| `5xx`  | Unexpected configuration or KV failure (plaintext)          |

```bash
curl -u admin:secure-password \
  "https://edge.example.com/_ts/admin/ec/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.abc123"

curl -u admin:secure-password \
  --cookie "ts-ec=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.abc123" \
  "https://edge.example.com/_ts/admin/ec"
```

### GET /\_ts/admin/eids

Parses the request's `ts-eids` and `sharedId` cookies and previews which configured partner IDs cookie ingestion would match or drop. It performs request inspection only: it does not read or write KV and is available on every adapter.

After successful authentication this endpoint always returns `200 OK`; missing or malformed cookies are represented by `cookie_present`, `sharedid_present`, and `parse_error`. The `ingest.matched` and `ingest.unmatched` arrays show the ingestion preview. Each unmatched entry contains its `source` and either a `no_partner` reason when no configured partner recognizes it or `no_valid_uid` when the partner exists but every supplied UID is empty or exceeds the storage limit.

```json
{
  "ingest": {
    "matched": [
      {
        "source_domain": "configured.example",
        "uid": "fictional-uid"
      }
    ],
    "unmatched": [
      {
        "source": "unknown.example",
        "reason": "no_partner"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

```bash
curl -u admin:secure-password \
  --cookie "sharedId=fictional-shared-id" \
  "https://edge.example.com/_ts/admin/eids"
```

Malformed diagnostic paths return a local `404`, and unsupported methods return a local `405`; they are never forwarded to the publisher origin.

## Authentication

### Basic Authentication

Endpoints under protected paths require HTTP Basic Authentication:

**Configuration:**

```toml
[[handlers]]
path = "^/_ts/admin"
username = "admin"
password = "secure-password"
```

**Usage:**

```bash
curl -u admin:secure-password https://edge.example.com/_ts/admin/keys/rotate
```

**Protected Endpoints:**

- `/_ts/admin/keys/rotate`
- `/_ts/admin/keys/deactivate`
- `/_ts/admin/ec`
- `/_ts/admin/ec/{id}`
- `/_ts/admin/eids`
- Any paths matching configured `handlers` patterns

---

## Rate Limiting

Trusted Server relies on Fastly's built-in rate limiting. Configure in Fastly dashboard:

**Recommended Limits:**

- Public endpoints: 1000 req/min per IP
- Admin endpoints: 10 req/min per IP
- TSJS serving: 10000 req/min (highly cacheable)

---

## CORS

CORS headers are not enabled by default. Configure `response_headers` for cross-origin requests:

```toml
[response_headers]
Access-Control-Allow-Origin = "*"
Access-Control-Allow-Methods = "GET, POST, OPTIONS"
Access-Control-Allow-Headers = "Content-Type, Authorization"
```
