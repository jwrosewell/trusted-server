# Testing

Trusted Server spans native and WebAssembly targets. Use the repository's
target-specific commands; `cargo test --workspace` is not a valid gate because
the adapters do not share one compilation target.

## Required gates

[AGENTS.md](https://github.com/IABTechLab/trusted-server/blob/main/AGENTS.md#ci-gates)
is the single source of truth for the complete local and CI gate matrix. Run
the checks that match the files you change. Pull-request CI covers the full
supported operating-system and target matrix.

## Adapter test targets

The aliases in `.cargo/config.toml` select the correct target and feature set:

| Adapter    | Test command            | Execution target                                         |
| ---------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Fastly     | `cargo test-fastly`     | `wasm32-wasip1` under Viceroy                            |
| Axum       | `cargo test-axum`       | Native host                                              |
| Cloudflare | `cargo test-cloudflare` | Native host tests; production builds use WASM            |
| Spin       | `cargo test-spin`       | Native host tests; production builds use `wasm32-wasip1` |

Fastly tests require the Viceroy version recorded in `.tool-versions`:

```bash
cargo install viceroy --version 0.17.0 --locked --force
rustup target add wasm32-wasip1 wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Pass a test-name filter after an alias to narrow a run:

```bash
cargo test-fastly test_generate_ec_id
cargo test-axum sets_geo_unavailable_header
```

Tests live beside their implementations in `#[cfg(test)]` modules. Read the
source test instead of copying it into another document; for example, EC ID
tests are in `crates/trusted-server-core/src/edge_cookie.rs`, creative rewrite
tests are in `crates/trusted-server-core/src/creative.rs`, and proxy tests are
in `crates/trusted-server-core/src/proxy.rs`.

## Documentation checks

Check the documentation surfaces from the repository root:

```bash
# Lint, format-check, and build the VitePress site (fails on dead links)
cd docs && npm ci && npm run lint && npm run format && npm run build

# Compile the maintained documentation snippet against the current core
cargo test --manifest-path crates/trusted-server-integration-tests/Cargo.toml --test documentation_snippets
```

The site build also runs on every pull request through the `format-docs` job.

## Cross-adapter parity and snippets

The native integration-test crate compares shared router behavior and compiles
the maintained integration-guide fixture:

```bash
cargo test --manifest-path crates/trusted-server-integration-tests/Cargo.toml --test parity
cargo test --manifest-path crates/trusted-server-integration-tests/Cargo.toml --test documentation_snippets
```

The snippet gate covers the marked fixture in the integration guide. Other
Rust examples must either be rustdoc tests or link to their source tests; prose
pages must not present copied implementation fragments as compiled examples.

## End-to-end publisher tests

The end-to-end script builds the Fastly and Axum adapters, creates generated
Viceroy configuration under `target/integration-test-artifacts`, builds the
WordPress and Next.js Docker fixtures, and runs the ignored integration suite
serially:

```bash
./scripts/integration-tests.sh
```

Pass a test filter to run one path:

```bash
./scripts/integration-tests.sh test_wordpress_axum
./scripts/integration-tests.sh test_nextjs_fastly
```

Browser coverage uses Playwright and Chromium against both fixtures:

```bash
./scripts/integration-tests-browser.sh
```

These suites require Docker, the pinned Node.js version, Viceroy, and the
`wasm32-wasip1` target. See the
[integration-test crate README](https://github.com/IABTechLab/trusted-server/blob/main/crates/trusted-server-integration-tests/README.md)
for the exact surfaces and retained build artifacts.

## Adapter runtime smokes

Each smoke script starts a real local runtime in temporary state. It verifies
missing configuration, each required secret, and a successful publisher proxy
request with URL rewriting:

```bash
./scripts/smoke-axum.sh
./scripts/smoke-fastly.sh
./scripts/smoke-cloudflare.sh
./scripts/smoke-spin.sh
```

The scripts build a missing adapter artifact when necessary. They require the
corresponding runtime CLI: Fastly CLI for Fastly, the pinned Wrangler release
for Cloudflare, and Spin CLI for Spin. Default ports can be overridden through
the environment variables documented in `scripts/README.md`.

## Debugging a failure

Show captured output and serialize a focused test when ordering or shared test
state matters:

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug cargo test-axum test_name -- --nocapture --test-threads=1
cargo test-fastly test_name -- --nocapture --test-threads=1
```

Viceroy reports the guest test output but may not provide a native-style stack
trace. Narrow the test filter first, then add temporary `log` diagnostics near
the failing boundary. Do not use `println!` in production code.
