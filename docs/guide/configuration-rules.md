# Configuration Rules

This page is for the people who write a Trusted Server configuration file and
for the people who write the code that reads it. It sets out the few rules
every part of the file follows, what Trusted Server checks before it serves a
request, and why the file is built this way.

## One rule for every type

Everything Trusted Server can switch on is a module, selected the same way:
the Edge Cookie identity, the location and device lookups, the permission
signals, the demand sources in an auction, the ad server that picks the
winner, and the page integrations.

```toml
[<type>]
module = "<name>"              # modules = [...] where several run

[<type>.<name>]                # only when the selected name has settings
setting = "value"
```

1. **The type is the job.** Each type is one top-level table, named for what
   its modules do: `ec`, `geo`, `device`, `permission-signal`, `demand` and
   `ad-server`, and the section of each module type, such as `cmp` or `tag`.
2. **The selector chooses what runs.** A type that runs one module takes
   `module`, a string. A type that runs several takes `modules`, a list.
3. **`[<type>.<name>]` holds the settings.** A name with nothing to set
   needs no table at all.
4. **The name is the implementation.** `[ec.hmac]` configures the `hmac`
   implementation. To run an implementation under a name of your own, add an
   `implementation` line. A demand source always has one, naming the
   implementation by its module path, such as
   `implementation = "auction.prebid-server"`, because `demand` is not the
   type its implementations are named under. That is how two Prebid Servers
   run side by side.
5. **A name is parts joined by `.`,** each of lower case letters, digits, `_`
   or `-`. A module from a crate is named by its folder below `crates/`, and
   may be written in full, as `permission-signal.gpc`, or with its section's
   type folder left off. Core's own modules, such as `hmac`, take bare names.
   A `[demand]` or `[ad-server]` name is snake_case, because it may be a label
   of your own.
6. **Secrets are key names.** A secret setting holds the name of a key in
   `trusted_server_secrets`, never the secret itself.

`auction-protocol.openrtb`, `auction.prebid-server`, `auction.aps` and `ad-server.mock` supply implementations
only. No module section selects them.

A module that an integration supplies needs that integration selected in the
section of its type too, because the module has to be registered before
another type can select what it offers.

A few types keep settings of their own beside the selector, where the setting
belongs to the job rather than to one name. `[ec]` holds `ec_store`, the
partner registry and the cluster thresholds, and `[geo]` holds
`assume_single_jurisdiction`. Those keys sit directly in the type's table.

### Leaving the selector out

| Type                                            | With no `module` or `modules` line                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ec`                                            | no Edge Cookie is created                                                         |
| `geo`                                           | no location is resolved and no host geo service is called                         |
| `device`                                        | `builtin` runs, which reads the User-Agent only                                   |
| `permission-signal`                             | every linked module runs, in the order shown above                                |
| `demand`                                        | no demand source is called                                                        |
| `ad-server`                                     | the highest bid wins, with no ad server                                           |
| a module type's section, such as `cmp` or `tag` | the section is refused, so remove the whole section when none of its modules runs |

## What is checked before a request is served

Every rule below refuses startup, and the message names the table and the fix.
Some are caught earlier, when the configuration is validated or pushed, and
the two lists say which.

- A `[<type>.<name>]` table that its type's selector does not name. A block
  left behind after a module is switched off is caught, rather than sitting
  unused and misleading the next reader.
- A selector entry, or an `implementation` line, that names an
  implementation this build does not have. The message lists the ones it does.
- A selected module that needs a setting its table does not give, such as
  `hmac` with no `passphrase`.
- A setting the selected name does not know. Every module and provider
  rejects unknown keys, so
  a misspelled setting fails instead of being ignored.
- A name that is not a module name, or a name selected twice.
- A key in a type's table that is neither the selector, one of that type's
  own settings, nor a named settings table.
- A `demand` or `ad-server` endpoint that is not HTTPS. Plain HTTP is allowed
  only to `127.0.0.1`, `::1` or `localhost`, so a local test stack runs
  without certificates and nothing leaves the machine unencrypted. An endpoint
  carrying credentials or a fragment is refused in every case.
- A secret setting whose key name is missing from `trusted_server_secrets`.

### Checked when the configuration is validated or pushed

`ts config validate`, `ts config diff` and `ts config push` all run the same
set. It is everything that can be decided from the file and from the
implementations compiled into the CLI.

- The whole auction plan, compiled from `[demand]`, `[ad-server]` and
  `[auction.bidders]`. That covers unselected tables, names that are not
  a module name, an implementation this build does not have, endpoint scheme and
  host, timeouts, routing modes, notification bounds, a bidder route naming a
  demand source `[demand] modules` does not select, and any setting the
  chosen implementation rejects.
- Every selected module's own settings, and the refusal of a table for a
  module its section does not select, of a section that selects nothing, and
  of the removed `[integrations]` and `[integration]` tables.
- Every secret setting holding a non-empty key name rather than a value, with a
  secret store declared to hold it.
- The placeholder values the template ships with.

### Checked when the service starts

Everything above runs again, on the configuration the instance actually
loaded, and these join it.

- Which modules `[ec]`, `[geo]`, `[device]` and `[permission-signal]`
  select. Those four are settled where the adapter composes the build, so a
  name this build does not have, a missing settings table, or a table the
  selector does not name, stops the service on its next start rather than the
  push. **A passing `ts config validate` is not proof that a change to those
  four will start.** Start an instance on the new configuration to find out.
- Assembling the integration registry, which is where a module that supplies an
  identity, location or device module is matched to the type that selected
  it, and where a name a section selects that no builder in this build
  supplies is refused. A module declaring an identity or device module that
  no type selects is logged as a warning here.
- The resolved secret values, which a key name alone cannot show. A weak or
  placeholder password fails here.
- The compiled `permissions.yaml` policy, and the acknowledgment an Edge
  Cookie module needs when no geo module is selected.
- The checks only the host can make, being backend name prediction and
  collisions, and whether the adapter can call more than one demand source at
  once.

## Settings that select nothing

The other tables configure Trusted Server itself rather than choose what runs.
They keep their own keys and have no selector.

| Table                                                      | Configures                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[publisher]`                                              | the site, its origin and the proxy secret                             |
| `[auction]`                                                | whether auctions run, the whole-auction timeout and creative handling |
| `[auction.bidders.<code>]`                                 | which demand provider a browser bidder code is sent to                |
| `[creative_opportunities]`                                 | server-rendered ad slots                                              |
| `[proxy]`, `[cache]`, `[rewrite]`                          | first-party proxying, caching and URL rewriting                       |
| `[request_signing]`, `[trusted_client_ip]`, `[[handlers]]` | signing, client addresses and admin access                            |
| `[debug]`, `[tinybird]`                                    | diagnostics and telemetry                                             |

## Why the file works this way

**For the people who run it.** There is one pattern to learn. Whether a
section chooses an identity module or the demand sources for an auction, the
question "what runs, and how is it set up" is answered the same way, in the
same place. A change reads plainly in review, because switching what runs is
a change to one selector line. And mistakes are caught when the
configuration is validated or the server starts, not when a visitor's request
takes an unexpected path. A leftover table, a misspelled setting or a name the
build does not know all stop the deployment with a message that names the
fix.

**For the people who write the code.** A module plugs in through one
registration and inherits the checks above without writing them again. Core
code does not name any vendor, so adding a module does not mean editing core,
and a vendor's crate can supply its own module on the same terms as the ones
in this repository.

**For everyone.** A configuration that cannot hold a silent mistake is one
that can be trusted in production and handed from one team to another.

## A complete example

A site with every kind of component the rules cover.

```toml
[[handlers]]
path = "^/_ts/admin"
username = "admin"
password = "handler_password"              # key name in trusted_server_secrets

[publisher]
domain = "example.com"
cookie_domain = ".example.com"
origin_url = "https://origin.example.com"
proxy_secret = "publisher_proxy_secret"    # key name

[proxy]
allowed_domains = ["assets.example.com"]

[ad-tag]
modules = ["google"]

[auction.prebid]
external_bundle_url = "https://assets.example.com/prebid/trusted-prebid.js"
timeout_ms = 1500                          # the browser's Prebid timeout

[ad-tag.google]
gam_attribution_enabled = true

[ec]
module = "hmac"
ec_store = "ec_identity_store"

[ec.hmac]
passphrase = "ec_passphrase"               # key name

[geo]
module = "platform"

[device]
module = "builtin"

[permission-signal]
modules = ["gpc", "gpp", "us-privacy", "tcf"]

[demand]
modules = ["pbs_main"]

[demand.pbs_main]
implementation = "auction.prebid-server"           # the name is a label of your own
endpoint = "https://prebid.example.com/openrtb2/auction"
timeout_ms = 1200                          # this demand source only
consent_forwarding = "both"

[ad-server]
module = "mock"

[ad-server.mock]
endpoint = "https://adserver.example.com/decide"
timeout_ms = 500

[auction]
modules = ["prebid"]
enabled = true
timeout_ms = 2000                          # the whole auction

[auction.bidders.example-server]
module = "pbs_main"

[creative_opportunities]
enabled = true
gam_network_id = "123456789"
auction_timeout_ms = 500                   # the page's server-side auction

[[creative_opportunities.slot]]
id = "leaderboard"
gam_unit_path = "/123456789/leaderboard"
div_id = "div-gpt-ad-leaderboard"
page_patterns = ["/"]
formats = [{ width = 728, height = 90 }]
```

Two Prebid Servers run side by side by giving each its own name and pointing
both at the same implementation.

```toml
[demand]
modules = ["pbs_main", "pbs_house"]

[demand.pbs_main]
implementation = "auction.prebid-server"
endpoint = "https://prebid.example.com/openrtb2/auction"

[demand.pbs_house]
implementation = "auction.prebid-server"
endpoint = "https://house.example.com/openrtb2/auction"
```

| `[auction.providers.<id>]` with `protocol`, `profile` and `profile_config`           | `[demand] modules` and `[demand.<name>]`, with `implementation` and the settings flat in the table |
| `profile = "standard"`                                                               | `implementation = "auction-protocol.openrtb"`                                                      |

| `[auction] mediator = "adserver_mock"` and `[integrations.adserver_mock]`            | `[ad-server] module = "mock"` and `[ad-server.mock]`                                               |
| `[integrations.aps] rendering_mode`                                                  | `rendering_mode` in the `[demand.<name>]` table of the `auction.aps` implementation                |
| `[debug.auction_html_comment_options] include_mediator_response`                     | `include_adserver_response`                                                                        |

The word mediator is gone with it. It is "ad server" in prose and `ad-server`
in configuration, and the auction response metadata that read
`parallel_mediation` now reads `parallel_adserver`.

`[auction] providers` and `[auction] mediator` are not ignored. A
configuration still carrying either is refused with a message naming where the
setting moved to.

## For developers adding a module

A module is registered by its integration builder, and the configuration
rules above apply to it without any extra code. See the
[integration guide](/guide/integration-guide) for the registration itself.
