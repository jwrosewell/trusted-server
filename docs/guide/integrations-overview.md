**When to use:** You have a Next.js application and want to ensure all links and assets route through your first-party domain.

**Learn more:** [Integration Guide](./integration-guide.md)

---

### Permutive

**What it does:** Provides first-party data collection and audience segmentation by proxying Permutive's SDK and API endpoints.

**Key Features:**

- Complete first-party SDK serving
- Multi-endpoint proxying (API, Events, Sync, Secure Signals, CDN)
- SDK caching for performance
- Cookies set on the publisher's domain
- Header forwarding for authentication

**Configuration:**

```toml
[integrations.permutive]
enabled = true
organization_id = "myorg"
workspace_id = "workspace-12345"
project_id = "project-789"
api_endpoint = "https://api.permutive.com"
secure_signals_endpoint = "https://secure-signals.permutive.app"
cache_ttl_seconds = 3600
rewrite_sdk = true
```

**Endpoints:**

- `GET /integrations/permutive/sdk` - SDK serving
- `GET/POST /integrations/permutive/api/*` - API proxy
- `GET/POST /integrations/permutive/secure-signal/*` - Secure Signals

### Sourcepoint

**What it does:** Proxies Sourcepoint CMP CDN endpoints through Trusted Server and rewrites publisher references to first-party paths.

**Key Features:**

- CDN proxy for `cdn.privacy-mgmt.com`
- HTML attribute rewriting for Sourcepoint assets
- JavaScript body rewriting for webpack chunks and API URLs
- Head-injected `window._sp_` property trap for runtime config
- Client-side script guard for dynamic script insertion

**Configuration:**

```toml
[integrations.sourcepoint]
enabled = true
rewrite_sdk = true
cdn_origin = "https://cdn.privacy-mgmt.com"
# auth_cookie_name = "sp_auth"
cache_ttl_seconds = 3600
```

**Endpoints:**

- `GET/POST /integrations/sourcepoint/cdn/*` - Sourcepoint CDN proxy

**When to use:** You load Sourcepoint CMP assets and want them to flow through first-party paths without introducing an open-ended proxy.

**Learn more:** [Sourcepoint Integration](./integrations/sourcepoint.md)

---

### Osano

**What it does:** Mirrors Osano's browser IAB API consent signals into standard first-party consent cookies for later Trusted Server requests.

**Key Features:**

- Mirrors USP, GPP, and TCF consent signals
- Writes `us_privacy`, `__gpp`, `__gpp_sid`, and `euconsent-v2`
- Marks owned cookies with `_ts_consent_src=osano`
- Preserves unmarked or foreign-owned consent cookies
- Clears stale Osano-owned cookies only after Osano readiness

**Configuration:**

```toml
[integrations.osano]
enabled = true
```

**Endpoints:** None. Osano v1 only enables the browser consent mirror module.

**Operational note:** Because mirroring runs in the browser after the page response starts, the first page request cannot include cookies written by the Osano mirror. Server-side consent behavior should rely on mirrored cookies from subsequent requests after Osano APIs are ready.

**When to use:** You use Osano for consent management and want Osano's browser consent signals available to Trusted Server as standard first-party cookies.

**Learn more:** [Osano Integration](./integrations/osano.md)

---

### GPT Runtime Diagnostics

**What it does:** Observes documented GPT lifecycle callbacks and Trusted Server integration evidence, then presents directly observed slot, request-path, delivery, timing, coverage, binding, and visibility facts in a local browser console.

**Key Features:**

- Explicit browser-session `ts_console` activation through a host-only HttpOnly cookie
- Conditional standalone delivery only on active HTML documents
- Initial and refresh request-cycle history, with observed request paths and replacements
- Delivery states derived only from observed Trusted Server creative evidence
- Source-neutral Ad Manager identifiers and response classes reported by GPT
- Conservative unmatched, ambiguous, and attribution issue reporting
- Exact DOM binding and non-layout-changing viewport badges
- Versioned local JSON export with no diagnostic upload
- No inferred demand ownership: a filled slot alone never proves Trusted Server delivery

**Configuration:**

```toml
[integrations.gpt_diagnostics]
enabled = true
```

**Endpoints:** None. The feature observes GPT in the browser and makes no diagnostic network request.

**When to use:** You need to debug GPT request, response, render, load, viewability, refresh, delivery-attribution, and slot-binding behavior without changing ad delivery.

**Learn more:** [GPT Runtime Diagnostics](./integrations/gpt-diagnostics.md)

---

### Testlight

**What it does:** Testing/development integration for validating the integration system with OpenRTB-like auctions.

**Key Features:**

- EC ID injection demonstration
- Flexible JSON schema (preserves unknown fields)
- Stream passthrough mode
- Script replacement capability
- Validation with serde + validator

**Configuration:**

```toml
[integrations.testlight]
enabled = true
endpoint = "https://testlight-server.example.com"
timeout_ms = 1000
shim_src = "/static/tsjs-unified.js"
rewrite_scripts = false
```

**Endpoints:**

- `POST /integrations/testlight/auction` - Auction endpoint with ID injection

**When to use:** You're developing or testing integration functionality and need a simple endpoint to validate EC ID injection.

**Learn more:** [Testing Guide](./testing.md)

---

## Integration Architecture

All integrations use a consistent architecture:

### Route Namespacing

- Pattern: `/integrations/{integration_name}/{endpoint}`
- Examples:
  - `/integrations/permutive/api/settings`
  - `/integrations/testlight/auction`

### Configuration Pattern

All integrations support:

- TOML configuration in `trusted-server.toml`
- Environment variable overrides
- Enable/disable flags
- Validation at startup

### Rewriting System

Integrations can implement four types of rewriting:

1. **HTTP Proxying** - Route requests through first-party domain
2. **HTML Attribute Rewriting** - Modify element attributes during streaming
3. **Script Content Rewriting** - Transform inline script content
4. **Head Injection** - Insert HTML snippets at the start of `<head>`

## Performance Considerations

| Integration         | Performance Impact | Caching Strategy              | Notes                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Prebid**          | Medium             | Response caching possible     | Timeout configurable (default 1s)               |
| **Next.js**         | Low                | N/A (streaming rewrite)       | Minimal overhead, runs during HTML streaming    |
| **Permutive**       | Low                | SDK cached (1 hour default)   | API calls proxied in real-time                  |
| **Sourcepoint**     | Low                | CDN cached (1 hour default)   | JS rewriting adds minor overhead                |
| **GPT Diagnostics** | Low when active    | Static module publicly cached | Module omitted until browser-session activation |
| **Testlight**       | Low                | No caching                    | Development use only                            |

## Environment Variables

All integrations can be configured via environment variables:

```bash
# Pattern: TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__{INTEGRATION}__{SETTING}

# Prebid
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__PREBID__SERVER_URL="https://new-server.com"
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__PREBID__TIMEOUT_MS=2000

# Next.js
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__NEXTJS__ENABLED=true

# Permutive
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__PERMUTIVE__ORGANIZATION_ID="neworg"
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__PERMUTIVE__WORKSPACE_ID="workspace-123"

# Sourcepoint
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__SOURCEPOINT__ENABLED=true
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__SOURCEPOINT__CDN_ORIGIN="https://cdn.privacy-mgmt.com"

# Testlight
TRUSTED_SERVER__INTEGRATIONS__TESTLIGHT__ENDPOINT="https://test.example.com"
```

See [Configuration Reference](./configuration.md) for complete details.

## Custom Integrations

You can create your own integrations by implementing the integration traits:

- `IntegrationProxy` - For HTTP endpoint proxying
- `IntegrationAttributeRewriter` - For HTML attribute rewriting
- `IntegrationScriptRewriter` - For script content transformation
- `IntegrationHeadInjector` - For injecting HTML snippets into `<head>`

See the [Integration Guide](./integration-guide.md) for details on building custom integrations.

An integration does not have to live in `trusted-server-core`. It can ship in its own crate that a deployment composes in at startup, which keeps the vendor's code and release cycle its own. See [Modules That Live Outside Core](./integration-guide.md#modules-that-live-outside-core).

## Common Questions

### Can I enable multiple integrations?

Yes! All integrations can run simultaneously. They operate independently and don't conflict.

### Do integrations affect page load time?

Minimal impact. HTML rewriting happens during streaming (Next.js), and proxy endpoints only execute when called. Prebid timeout is configurable.

### Can I disable integrations at runtime?

No. Integration configuration is read at startup. You must redeploy to change integration settings.

### Are integrations required?

No. All integrations are optional. You can run Trusted Server with no integrations enabled and use it purely for EC ID generation and first-party proxying.

### How do I add a new integration?

See the [Integration Guide](./integration-guide.md) for a complete tutorial on building custom integrations.
