# Getting Started

Get up and running with Trusted Server quickly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed (versions are pinned in `.tool-versions`):

- Rust {{RUST_VERSION}} (see `.tool-versions`)
- NodeJS {{NODEJS_VERSION}}
- Basic familiarity with Rust and WebAssembly

**For Fastly deployment** (optional for local dev):

- Fastly {{FASTLY_VERSION}} CLI installed
- Chrome or Chromium, required for `ts audit`
- A Fastly account and API key

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IABTechLab/trusted-server.git
cd trusted-server
```

### Install the CLI

Install the `ts` operator CLI for your current platform:

```bash
cargo install-cli

# If your shell cannot find `ts`, add Cargo's bin directory to PATH
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
ts --help
```

See [Trusted Server CLI](/guide/cli) for command details.

## Local Development

Trusted Server supports two local development modes:

### Option A — Fastly Compute via Viceroy

Simulates the full Fastly production environment locally.

Install and configure the Fastly CLI using the [Fastly setup guide](/guide/fastly), then install Viceroy:

```bash
cargo install viceroy --version 0.17.0 --locked --force
```

Create and push the starter config, then start the local Fastly simulator:

```bash
cp trusted-server.example.toml trusted-server.toml
set -a && source .env.dev && set +a

ts config push --adapter fastly --local --yes --no-diff
fastly compute serve
```

The local manifest provides public development-only values for the starter
config's three secret references. Do not reuse them outside local development.
The server will be available at `http://localhost:7676`.

### Option B — Axum dev server

No Fastly account, CLI, or Viceroy needed. Runs natively on your machine.

The Axum adapter reads the EdgeZero config blob and secret store from
environment variables — it does **not** auto-load `.env` files. You must export
the variables into your shell before starting the server.

```bash
# Create the local app config and apply the non-secret development overlay.
cp trusted-server.example.toml trusted-server.toml
set -a && source .env.dev && set +a

# Create the local blob-backed config-store entry.
ts config push --adapter axum --local --yes
export TRUSTED_SERVER_CONFIG_TRUSTED_SERVER_CONFIG_TRUSTED_SERVER_CONFIG="$(
  jq -r '.trusted_server_config' .edgezero/local-config-trusted_server_config.json
)"

# Populate the three secret references from the starter config for this shell.
# Use stable values only if you need existing proxy URLs or EC IDs to remain valid.
export TRUSTED_SERVER_SECRET_TRUSTED_SERVER_SECRETS_PUBLISHER_PROXY_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
export TRUSTED_SERVER_SECRET_TRUSTED_SERVER_SECRETS_EC_PASSPHRASE="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
export TRUSTED_SERVER_SECRET_TRUSTED_SERVER_SECRETS_HANDLER_PASSWORD="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"

# Build and start the dev server in the same shell.
cargo run -p trusted-server-adapter-axum
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:8787`. Set `PORT=<port>` before
`cargo run` to bind the dev server to a different local port.

**Environment variable conventions used by the Axum adapter:**

| Purpose            | Pattern                                         | Example                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Config store value | `TRUSTED_SERVER_CONFIG_{STORE}_{KEY}`           | `TRUSTED_SERVER_CONFIG_TRUSTED_SERVER_CONFIG_TRUSTED_SERVER_CONFIG=…`           |
| Secret store value | `TRUSTED_SERVER_SECRET_{STORE}_{KEY}`           | `TRUSTED_SERVER_SECRET_TRUSTED_SERVER_SECRETS_PROXY_KEY=…`                      |
| TLS certificate    | `TRUSTED_SERVER_TLS_CERTIFICATE_PATH`           | `TRUSTED_SERVER_TLS_CERTIFICATE_PATH=/etc/trusted-server/site.pem`              |
| TLS private key    | `TRUSTED_SERVER_TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`           | `TRUSTED_SERVER_TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/etc/trusted-server/site-key.pem`          |
| KV store file      | `EDGEZERO__STORES__KV__TRUSTED_SERVER_KV__PATH` | `EDGEZERO__STORES__KV__TRUSTED_SERVER_KV__PATH=/var/lib/trusted-server/kv.redb` |

The config-store value is the verified app-config blob. Secret-store values are
looked up by the key names in that blob. Store names and key names are uppercased
with hyphens and dots replaced by underscores. The quick-start exports ephemeral
secret-store values only into the current shell; do not put secret values in the
TOML config, config-store blob, or a source-controlled environment file.

### Serving HTTPS

The adapter serves plain HTTP unless both TLS variables above are set, in which
case it terminates TLS itself on the same address and no separate terminator is
needed. Setting only one of the two stops startup rather than serving plain HTTP
on an address the operator believes is encrypted.

The certificate is a PEM chain with the leaf first and the key is its PEM
private key, which is what most issuers hand you and what `mkcert` writes for a
local development certificate.

The KV store is a `redb` database file, created on first start at
`.edgezero/trusted_server_kv.redb` unless the path above is set. `.edgezero/` is
already in `.gitignore`. The database is locked for exclusive use, so a second
dev server started in the same directory will refuse to start rather than share
the file. That is deliberate, because the store holds identity and consent
state, and a lost consent withdrawal cannot be told apart from a reader who
never withdrew.

> **Dev server limitations:** The Axum adapter does not support geo lookup,
> config/secret-store writes, or admin key-management routes.
> See [Architecture](/guide/architecture) for the full list.

### Build the Project

```bash
# Axum dev server (native)
cargo build -p trusted-server-adapter-axum

# Fastly adapter (WASM)
cargo build -p trusted-server-adapter-fastly --target wasm32-wasip1
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Fastly/WASM crates (requires Viceroy)
cargo test-fastly

# Axum native adapter
cargo test-axum
```

## Configuration

Create a starter Trusted Server config with the `ts` CLI:

```bash
ts config init
```

To bootstrap from a public publisher page, run an audit first:

```bash
ts audit generate https://publisher.example
```

The audit command writes `js-assets.toml` plus a draft `trusted-server.toml`.
The draft includes disabled JS Asset Proxy candidates for detected third-party
scripts. Review it, replace placeholders with stable secret key names, and enable
only the asset proxy entries you want to serve or block. Then validate it.

Edit `trusted-server.toml` to configure:

- the integrations that run, in `[integration] provider`, with their settings under `[integration.<id>]`
- the demand sources, in `[demand] provider`, each with its settings under `[demand.<name>]`
- the ad server, if one runs, in `[adserver] provider`, with its settings under `[adserver.<name>]`
- server bidder routes under `[auction.bidders.<code>]`
- KV store mappings
- Edge Cookie configuration under `[ec]`
- stable key names for `trusted_server_secrets`

Do not put a Prebid Server URL or server bidder list under
`[integration.prebid]`. Those server values belong to a `[demand.<name>]` table
whose `implementation` is `prebid_server`, and APS has no integration table at
all, because it is selected in `[demand]` too. The rules every one of these
tables follows are in [Configuration Rules](/guide/configuration-rules).

Before the first push, provision the physical store mapped from logical
`trusted_server_secrets` with the credential values referenced by the config.
On Fastly, `ts_secrets` is the documented example physical name. Then validate
and push:

```bash
ts config validate
ts config push --adapter fastly
```

This command performs target-independent plan validation. Each adapter performs
mandatory target-aware fan-out and backend-name validation at startup. The
EdgeZero callback needed for target-aware pre-write push validation is not yet
available in this tree, so startup remains the final target gate.

Restart or redeploy instances after secret rotation. See
[Configuration](/guide/configuration) and [Trusted Server CLI](/guide/cli) for details.

## Deploy to Fastly

```bash
fastly compute publish
