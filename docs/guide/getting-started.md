# Getting Started

Get up and running with Trusted Server quickly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed (versions are pinned in `.tool-versions`):

- Rust {{RUST_VERSION}} (see `.tool-versions`)
- NodeJS {{NODEJS_VERSION}}
- Basic familiarity with Rust and WebAssembly

**For Fastly deployment** (optional for local dev):

- Fastly {{FASTLY_VERSION}} CLI installed
- Chrome or Chromium, required for `ts audit`
- A Fastly account and API key

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IABTechLab/trusted-server.git
cd trusted-server
```

### Install the CLI

Install the `ts` operator CLI for your current platform:

```bash
cargo install-cli

# If your shell cannot find `ts`, add Cargo's bin directory to PATH
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
ts --help
```

See [Trusted Server CLI](/guide/cli) for command details.

## Local Development

Trusted Server supports two local development modes:

### Option A — Fastly Compute via Viceroy

Simulates the full Fastly production environment locally.

Install and configure the Fastly CLI using the [Fastly setup guide](/guide/fastly), then install Viceroy:

```bash
cargo install viceroy --version 0.17.0 --locked --force
```

Start the local Fastly simulator:

```bash
fastly compute serve
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:7676`.

### Option B — Axum dev server

No Fastly account, CLI, or Viceroy needed. Runs natively on your machine.

The Axum adapter reads configuration from environment variables — it does **not**
auto-load `.env` files. You must export the variables into your shell before starting
the server.

```bash
# Copy and edit the environment file
cp .env.dev .env

# Export the variables into your current shell session
set -a && source .env && set +a

# Build and start the dev server
cargo run -p trusted-server-adapter-axum
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:8787`. Set `PORT=<port>` before
`cargo run` to bind the dev server to a different local port.

**Environment variable conventions used by the Axum adapter:**

| Purpose            | Pattern                                         | Example                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Config store value | `TRUSTED_SERVER_CONFIG_{STORE}_{KEY}`           | `TRUSTED_SERVER_CONFIG_SETTINGS_AD_SERVER_URL=https://…`                        |
| Secret store value | `TRUSTED_SERVER_SECRET_{STORE}_{KEY}`           | `TRUSTED_SERVER_SECRET_KEYS_SIGNING_KEY=abc123`                                 |
| KV store file      | `EDGEZERO__STORES__KV__TRUSTED_SERVER_KV__PATH` | `EDGEZERO__STORES__KV__TRUSTED_SERVER_KV__PATH=/var/lib/trusted-server/kv.redb` |

Store names and key names are uppercased with hyphens and dots replaced by underscores.

The KV store is a `redb` database file, created on first start at
`.edgezero/trusted_server_kv.redb` unless the path above is set. `.edgezero/` is
already in `.gitignore`. The database is locked for exclusive use, so a second
dev server started in the same directory will refuse to start rather than share
the file. That is deliberate, because the store holds identity and consent
state, and a lost consent withdrawal cannot be told apart from a reader who
never withdrew.

> **Dev server limitations:** The Axum adapter does not support geo lookup,
> config/secret-store writes, or admin key-management routes.
> See [Architecture](/guide/architecture) for the full list.

### Build the Project

```bash
# Axum dev server (native)
cargo build -p trusted-server-adapter-axum

# Fastly adapter (WASM)
cargo build -p trusted-server-adapter-fastly --target wasm32-wasip1
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Fastly/WASM crates (requires Viceroy)
cargo test-fastly

# Axum native adapter
cargo test-axum
```

## Configuration

Create a starter Trusted Server config with the `ts` CLI:

```bash
ts config init
```

To bootstrap from a public publisher page, run an audit first:

```bash
ts audit https://publisher.example
```

The audit command writes `js-assets.toml` plus a draft `trusted-server.toml`.
Review the draft, replace placeholders/secrets, then validate it.

Edit `trusted-server.toml` to configure:

- Ad server integrations
- KV store mappings
- EC configuration
- Consent settings (`[gdpr]`)

Validate the config before pushing it to platform storage:

```bash
ts config validate
```

See [Configuration](/guide/configuration) and [Trusted Server CLI](/guide/cli) for details.

## Deploy to Fastly

```bash
fastly compute publish
```
