## Revenue & Monetization

### 1. Increased Ad Revenue in Cookieless Environments

**Problem**: Safari and Firefox restrict third-party cookie scope, reducing cross-site identifier continuity and addressable inventory CPMs by 30-50%.

**Solution**: Trusted Server's Edge Cookie (EC) system provides first-party identifiers for user recognition in restricted cookie environments.

**Business Impact**:

- **Revenue Recovery**: Restore 30-40% of lost Safari/Firefox CPM
- **Addressable Inventory**: Increase addressable inventory from 60% to 95%
- **Annual Value**: $500K+ for mid-sized publisher (10M monthly visits)

**Metrics**:

- CPM lift: +35% in Safari
- Fill rate increase: +25% in cookieless browsers
- Identity resolution rate: 90%+ vs 40% with third-party cookies

### 2. Premium Audience Data Monetization

**Problem**: Publishers collect valuable first-party data but struggle to monetize it while maintaining user privacy and compliance.

**Solution**: Trusted Server enables controlled, granular sharing of audience segments with buyer partners through secure, consent-based mechanisms.

**Business Impact**:

- **Higher CPMs**: Premium segments command 2-5x higher CPMs
- **Data Scarcity Value**: Limited sharing increases data value
- **New Revenue Stream**: Audience data licensing opportunities

**Example ROI**:

### 3. Server-Side Header Bidding Performance

**Problem**: Client-side header bidding slows page loads by 1-3 seconds, reducing user engagement and ad viewability.

**Business Impact**:

- **Faster Page Loads**: 1.5-2s improvement
- **Higher Viewability**: +15% viewable impressions
- **Better UX**: Reduced bounce rate = more pageviews = more ad impressions

**Revenue Math**:

- 10M monthly pageviews
- 15% viewability improvement = 1.5M additional viewable impressions
- Average CPM: $2.50
- **Monthly Revenue Increase**: $45K ($540K annually)

**Performance Metrics**:

- Time to First Byte: -200ms
- Largest Contentful Paint: -1.2s
- Cumulative Layout Shift: -0.15 (better Core Web Vitals)
