//! Derives `page_patterns` globs from the paths a slot was actually observed on.
//!
//! A slot seen on `/news/story-abc` should serve every article in that section,
//! not just that one URL — but nothing here extrapolates beyond a *witnessed*
//! section. Each observed path contributes the section prefix it belongs to and
//! nothing else, so a crawl that never visited `/reviews` never claims it.
//!
//! Each section yields a pair, because one glob cannot cover both halves:
//! `*` crosses `/` in this glob dialect, so `/news/*` matches `/news/a/b` but
//! **not** the bare `/news` landing page. Emitting only the star form silently
//! drops the landing page from the slot.

/// `section_segment` is the index the section is taken from, matching the
/// config key of the same name: a path is reduced to its first
/// `section_segment + 1` segments, which is the prefix every page of that
/// section shares. A shorter observed landing path is emitted literally; only
/// the actual site root contributes `/`.
///
/// Results are deduplicated and ordered with `/` first, then alphabetically, so
/// re-running against unchanged evidence produces an unchanged file.
