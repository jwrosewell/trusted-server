//! Infers a `{network_id}`/`{section}` ad-unit template from observed evidence.
//!
//! The generator otherwise writes the literal path each page happened to
//! request, which pins a slot to the one section it was scraped from. A template
//! generalizes across sections — but a *wrong* template makes the publisher bid
//! against inventory that does not exist, which is worse than a narrow literal.
//! So this module is built to refuse rather than guess.
//!
//! The inference applies three evidence rules:
//!
//! 1. **Positional binding.** `{network_id}` is bound to unit segment 0 and only
//!    if that segment is the resolved network id. Substring replacement would
//!    corrupt `/123/sports123/home` into `/{network_id}/sports{network_id}/home`.
//! 2. **Exactly one varying segment.** Zero means nothing was proven and the
//!    path stays literal; two means the unit varies along a dimension the
//!    request path cannot supply (device, geo, experiment), so it is refused.
//! 3. **Cross-page variation.** Two pages must show *different* derived sections
//!    and different unit segments. A single-page crawl is
//!    indistinguishable from a static path — literal, `{network_id}`-only and
//!    `{section}` all reproduce one observation equally well, and round-trip
//!    verification cannot tell them apart. Only variation can.
//!
//! Every accepted template is then replayed through the runtime's own
//! [`render_gam_unit_path`](CreativeOpportunitySlot::render_gam_unit_path) and
//! [`derive_section`] against every observation. A template that does not
//! reproduce what the live page actually requested is downgraded, not written.
