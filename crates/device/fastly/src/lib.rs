//! The Fastly device provider and host-signal capture.
//!
//! [`FastlyDeviceProvider`] strengthens the built-in User-Agent classification
//! with the host's TLS (JA4) and HTTP/2 signals, for deployments on Fastly
//! Compute. It is selected by `[device] provider = "fastly"` and wired in by the
//! Fastly adapter, which injects the request info and the captured host signals.
//!
//! [`FastlyHostSignals`] captures those signals from a live Fastly request
//! (`get_tls_ja4()`, `get_client_h2_fingerprint()`) into owned values, so it can
//! be shared as an injected [`HostSignals`] service that outlives the borrow of
//! the request. Capturing through the SDK is why this crate depends on the
//! `fastly` crate and builds only for the `wasm32-wasip1` target; off-host the
//! accessors return `None`, so classification degrades to User-Agent only. The
//! platform-neutral [`HostSignals`], [`RequestInfo`], and [`DeviceProvider`]
//! traits and the built-in default live in `trusted-server-core`, where the
//! `DeviceSignals` classification logic stays unit-tested.
