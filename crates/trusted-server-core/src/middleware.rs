//! Page changes, which a module makes to a document on its way to a reader.
//!
//! A module changes a page through a middleware and in no other way. It
//! registers the ones it supplies, and one runs only where an entry in the
//! settings names it. Each phase has its own ordered list of entries. An
//! entry covers one media type, optionally only the requests under a path
//! prefix, and names the middleware to run in order. A response takes the
//! first entry that covers it, and each middleware is handed the document as
//! the ones before it left it.
//!
//! ```toml
//! [[fetch]]
//! media_type = "text/html"
//! path = "/news/"
//! middleware = ["example.strip", "example.tag"]
//!
//! [[fetch]]
//! media_type = "text/html"
//! middleware = ["example.strip"]
//!
//! [[serve]]
//! media_type = "text/html"
//! middleware = ["example.reader"]
//! ```
//!
//! An entry carries no settings and switches nothing on. Whether a module
//! runs is decided by the section that selects it, and an entry places and
//! orders the page changes of the modules that run. A middleware reads its
//! settings from its module's own table.
//!
//! Fetch is obtaining the document from the origin. A fetch middleware is
//! handed nothing about the reader, so what it leaves is what a shared
//! template stores for every reader. Serve is preparing the document for one
//! response. A serve middleware runs for each reader, on that reader's copy,
//! whether the page came from the store or from the origin, and nothing it
//! writes is stored.
