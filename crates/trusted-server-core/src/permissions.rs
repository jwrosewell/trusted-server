//! Provider permissions: a technical permission model gating provider execution.
//!
//! A provider advertises the [`Permission`]s its data use *requires*. Trusted
//! Server resolves which permissions are currently *set* from the session's
//! signals and the country it resolves to, and refuses to run the Edge Cookie
//! provider when its required permissions are not set. The device and geo
//! providers declare their requirements through the same method, and the
//! built-in ones require none; gating their execution on that declaration is
//! follow-up work.
//!
//! The vocabulary is the IAB Privacy Taxonomy Data Uses, mapped from the IAB TCF
//! Europe purposes and used **only** as a technical identifier for a permission.
//! Two purposes have no Data Use yet: TCF purpose 1 (device storage) uses a
//! proposed `necessary.operations.storage` key and TCF purpose 11 keeps its TCF
//! identifier. No CMP or TCF *policy* is implemented here. Every TCF purpose
//! is resolved against the session's signals (a present TCF record grants or
//! revokes each purpose, and a US-style opt-out revokes), and the Data Uses
//! with no TCF purpose keep their configured baseline.
//!
//! How a permission is acquired varies by country, so resolution is keyed on the
//! ISO 3166-1 country code a geo provider returns. [`PermissionMaps::standard`]
//! loads the default country and region rules from the embedded
//! `permissions.yaml` (see `DEFAULT_PERMISSION_RULES`).
//! When no country is identified (no geo provider, or a lookup that resolves
//! nothing) or the resolved country/region has no rule, resolution uses the
//! deployer's configured default country (`[geo] default_country`). With none
//! configured, a permission is set only when the incoming signals explicitly
//! grant it. A geo provider that reports an outright lookup failure is the
//! exception, resolving every permission to the requires-signal floor rather
//! than the default, though no geo provider shipped today reports one.
