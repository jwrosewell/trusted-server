//! Each contributor's answer, held in the key-value store between requests.
//!
//! A contributor is asked when nothing of its is held, or when what is held
//! is older than the contributor's own refresh. Its answer is then stored and
//! serves every request until the refresh is due again.
//!
//! What is held is kept far longer than any refresh, and is served past its
//! age when the contributor fails, because yesterday's rules are a better
//! answer than none. A `404` or an empty file reads to a crawler as permission
//! to crawl everything, which is the opposite of what a publisher who refused
//! anything asked for.
//!
//! A store that cannot give an entry a lifetime is written without one. An
//! answer held for settings that have since changed then stays in that store,
//! one small entry for each change, until it is deleted there.
//!
//! A deployment with no key-value store holds nothing. Every request for the
//! file then asks each contributor, and a contributor that fails fails the
//! file.
