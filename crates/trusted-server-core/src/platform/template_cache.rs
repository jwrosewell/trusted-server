//! The shared transformed-template cache for the #1009 ESI validation spike.
//!
//! Three caches are in play and conflating them is what produced the original wrong
//! conclusion in the design doc, so this module names which one it is:
//!
//! | Cache | Contents                          | Owner                          |
//! | ----- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
//! | C1    | raw origin bytes                  | Fastly read-through. Not this. |
//! | Template cache | post-`lol_html`, pre-assembly     | **This module.**       |
//! | Final response | final per-user assembled response | **Must never exist.** |
//!
//! The template cache holds a *shared template*: no per-user bytes, and no decisions that depend on
//! the request. What may and may not live in it is
//! [§6.7 of the design doc](../../../../docs/superpowers/archive/2026-08-08-esi-cacheable-root-validation-design.md),
//! and the invariant is enforced by the rendered-document byte-identity tests in
//! `publisher`.
//!
//! Spike-only. Remove with the spike.
