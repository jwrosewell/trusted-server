//! Edge Cookie identity modules.
//!
//! An [`EdgeCookieModule`] derives an Edge Cookie identifier. The module is
//! selected by configuration, with no default, and [`build_module`] is the
//! composition root that builds the selected one. A built-in module is
//! constructed from its `[ec.<name>]` block, and a vendor module is taken
//! from the adapter that injected it. A built-in module that also needs a
//! host service, as the host-signal module needs the [`HostSignals`]
//! service, is built only on a host that supplies that service. Construction
//! reads configuration and long-lived services, so a selection this deployment
//! cannot satisfy fails at startup rather than leaving it running without an
//! identity. Fastly, Cloudflare and Spin resolve the module once per
//! application state and thread the result. Axum and embedders resolve per
//! request. The host-signal module is the exception, being built per request
//! from that request's TLS and HTTP/2 signals (see
//! [`is_request_scoped`](EdgeCookieModule::is_request_scoped)).
//!
//! Request evidence reaches a module at call time rather than at
//! construction. [`EdgeCookieModule::generate`] is handed a [`ModuleCall`],
//! and the module names what it reads from the request's module context, such
//! as the [`RequestInfo`] carrying the normalized client IP, the User-Agent and
//! the request headers, or the permissions and consent resolved for the
//! request. A module reads what it needs and retains nothing. Core snapshots
//! the headers and what the request resolved to at read time, for generation
//! later in the request, and the module itself keeps none of it.
//!
//! [`HmacModule`] is the built-in server-side implementation. It derives the
//! identifier from the client IP using HMAC over the configured passphrase.
