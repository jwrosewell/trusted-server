//! Edge Cookie identity providers.
//!
//! An [`EdgeCookieProvider`] derives an Edge Cookie identifier. The provider is
//! selected by configuration, with no default, and [`build_provider`] is the
//! composition root that builds the selected one. A built-in provider is
//! constructed from its `[ec.providers.<key>]` block, and a vendor provider is
//! taken from the adapter that injected it. A built-in provider that also needs
//! a host service, as the host-signal provider needs the [`HostSignals`]
//! service, is built only on a host that supplies that service.
//! Construction reads configuration and long-lived services, so a selection
//! this deployment cannot satisfy fails at startup rather than leaving it
//! running without an identity. The host-signal provider is the exception: it
//! is built per request from that request's TLS and HTTP/2 signals (see
//! [`is_request_scoped`](EdgeCookieProvider::is_request_scoped)).
//!
//! Request evidence reaches a provider at call time rather than at
//! construction. [`EdgeCookieProvider::generate`] borrows a [`RequestInfo`],
//! which carries the normalized client IP, the User-Agent and the request
//! headers, for the life of the call, alongside an [`IdentityInput`] holding
//! the request's gating context. A provider reads what it needs and retains
//! nothing. Core snapshots the headers, path and query it lends to the provider
//! at generate time, and the provider itself keeps none of it.
//!
//! [`HmacProvider`] is the built-in server-side implementation. It derives the
//! identifier from the client IP using HMAC over the configured passphrase, the
//! behavior Trusted Server has always shipped.
