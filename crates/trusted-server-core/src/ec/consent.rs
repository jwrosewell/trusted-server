//! EC-specific permission gating, resolved through the permission model.
//!
//! The Edge Cookie module advertises the [`Permission`]s its data use
//! requires. [`assemble_permissions`] resolves which permissions are set for a
//! request, from the country it maps to and what the signal modules say,
//! and the context construction gates the module on that state. The EC
//! permission decision lives here, in the EC subsystem, and nowhere else, so
//! callers route every EC permission check through this module rather than
//! re-deriving one.
//!
//! No scheme is decoded here. Which signals count, and what each says about
//! a permission, is answered by the [`PermissionSignalModule`]s the adapter
//! hands in, every one of which is a crate outside core. This module asks
//! them in order and applies the country and region rules to what they
//! settle on.
