//! Edge Cookie (EC) identity subsystem.
//!
//! This module owns the EC lifecycle:
//!
//! 1. **Read** — [`EcContext::read_from_request`] extracts any existing EC ID
//!    from cookies, captures the client IP, and builds the consent
//!    context. This is called pre-routing on every request.
//!
//! 2. **Generate** — [`EcContext::generate_if_needed`] creates a new EC ID
//!    when none exists and consent allows it. This is called only in organic
//!    handlers (publisher proxy, integration proxy) — never in read-only
//!    endpoints like `/_ts/api/v1/identify`.
//!
//! # Module structure
//!
//! - auth (private) — shared Bearer-token authentication helpers
//! - [`generation`] — HMAC-based ID generation, IP normalization, format helpers
//! - [`consent`]: EC-specific permission gating, with consent as one input
//! - [`cookies`] — `Set-Cookie` header creation and expiration helpers
//! - [`finalize`]: the cookie and identity-graph writes made on the response
//!   after routing
//! - [`kv`] — KV Store identity graph operations (CAS, tombstones, debounce)
//! - [`kv_backend`] — Platform-neutral KV primitives implemented by adapters
//! - [`kv_types`] — Schema types for KV identity graph entries
//! - [`device`]: Device signal derivation (UA, JA4, H2 SETTINGS)
//! - [`partner`] — Partner validation helpers (ID format, pull sync config)
//! - [`module`]: Edge Cookie modules and their selection
//! - [`registry`] — In-memory partner registry built from config
//! - [`rate_limiter`] — Rate limiting abstraction (implemented by adapters)
//! - [`identify`] — Identity read endpoint (`GET /_ts/api/v1/identify`)
//! - [`eids`] — Shared EID resolution and formatting helpers
//! - [`batch_sync`] — S2S batch sync endpoint (`POST /_ts/api/v1/batch-sync`)
//! - [`pull_sync`] — Background pull-sync dispatcher for organic routes
