//! IAB TCF v2 as a permission signal module.
//!
//! Answers from the decoded TCF record for the purposes this crate maps to
//! each permission, and is the one place that knows what a TCF purpose is.
//! Core decodes the TC string, keeps the record against the Edge Cookie
//! identifier, expires it by age and resolves it against a GPP EU section, and
//! this module reads what that pipeline produced rather than decoding the
//! cookie a second time. Reading the wire directly would silently skip the
//! cached record on a returning visitor and the expiry rule, and answer
//! differently from every other reader of the same request.
//!
//! This module lives outside `trusted-server-core` deliberately, like every
//! scheme. Why is set out once, in `permission_signal/README.md` in core.
