//! Which app-config blob serves a request.
//!
//! A service reads one blob, at the key its `__KEY` selector names or at the
//! logical store ID. A selector that carries [`HOST_PLACEHOLDER`] names a blob
//! for each host instead. The placeholder is replaced by the host a request
//! names, so one service serves several publishers, each from a blob of its
//! own.
//!
//! A host that has no blob is refused. It is never answered from another key,
//! because a shared fallback is how a host nobody configured comes to be
//! served another publisher's site.
