## Project Overview

Rust-based edge computing application targeting **Fastly Compute**. Handles
Edge Cookie (EC) ID generation, ad serving with consent signal extraction
and enforcement, real-time bidding integration, and publisher-side
JavaScript injection.

## Build & Test Commands

### Rust

```bash
# Build (per-target aliases — bare `cargo build` fails at the workspace root)
cargo build-fastly && cargo build-axum && cargo build-cloudflare

# Production build for Fastly
cargo build --package trusted-server-adapter-fastly --release --target wasm32-wasip1

# Run locally with Fastly simulator
fastly compute serve

# Deploy to Fastly
fastly compute publish

# Run Axum dev server (native — no Viceroy). Settings load at runtime from the
# platform config store on every adapter; publish an operator config with
# `ts config push` (see trusted-server.example.toml for the template).
cargo run -p trusted-server-adapter-axum

# Test Axum adapter only
cargo test-axum

# Check Cloudflare adapter (native)
cargo check -p trusted-server-adapter-cloudflare

# Check Cloudflare adapter (WASM target — alias for the full command)
cargo check-cloudflare

# Test Cloudflare adapter (native host)
cargo test-cloudflare

# Check Spin adapter (native)
cargo check -p trusted-server-adapter-spin

# Check Spin adapter (WASM target)
cargo check-spin

# Test Spin adapter (native host)
cargo test-spin

# Production-style Spin WASM artifact used by crates/trusted-server-adapter-spin/spin.toml
cargo build --package trusted-server-adapter-spin --target wasm32-wasip1 --features spin --release

# Optional local Spin runtime smoke, if the Spin CLI is installed
spin up --from crates/trusted-server-adapter-spin
```

### Testing & Quality

```bash
# Run all Rust tests — use workspace aliases (see .cargo/config.toml)
# default-members = [fastly] so Viceroy can locate the binary via `cargo run --bin`.
cargo test-fastly      # Fastly adapter + core (wasm32-wasip1 via Viceroy)
cargo test-axum        # Axum dev server adapter (native)
cargo test-cloudflare  # Cloudflare Workers adapter (native host)
cargo test-spin        # Spin adapter route tests (native host)

# Run host-target CLI tests (workspace default target is wasm32-wasip1)
# Use your host triple, for example x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu on CI/Linux
# or aarch64-apple-darwin on Apple Silicon macOS.
# Use the local helper (recommended):
# ./scripts/test-cli.sh
cargo test --package trusted-server-cli --target <host-triple>

# Format
cargo fmt --all -- --check

# Lint by adapter target — target-matched clippy is the blocking gate because
# the workspace has multiple wasm runtimes and runtime-specific SDKs. A plain
# `cargo clippy --workspace --all-features` would trip the cloudflare
# feature's non-wasm32 compile_error! guard.
cargo clippy-fastly
cargo clippy-axum
cargo clippy-cloudflare
cargo clippy-cloudflare-wasm
cargo clippy-spin-native
cargo clippy-spin-wasm

# Check compilation (per-target aliases — bare `cargo check` fails at the workspace root)
cargo check-fastly && cargo check-axum && cargo check-cloudflare

# JS tests
cd crates/trusted-server-js/lib && npx vitest run

# JS format
cd crates/trusted-server-js/lib && npm run format

# Docs format
cd docs && npm run format

# JS build
cd crates/trusted-server-js/lib && node build-all.mjs
```

### Install prerequisites

```bash
cargo install viceroy --version 0.17.0 --locked --force
```

### Windows (use WSL for the Linux-only tests)

The Rust adapter tests run natively on Windows through the cargo aliases
(`cargo test-fastly` via Viceroy, `cargo test-axum`, `cargo test-cloudflare`),
and CI runs these on both `ubuntu-latest` and `windows-latest`.

The Docker-based integration suite (`scripts/integration-tests.sh`) and the
Cloudflare worker build (`crates/trusted-server-adapter-cloudflare/build.sh`,
which uses `worker-build` + `wrangler dev`) are Linux tools. On Windows run them
inside WSL (Ubuntu) with Docker Desktop's WSL integration enabled. Provision the
WSL distro with the same toolchain as `.tool-versions` (rustup + the
`wasm32-wasip1` / `wasm32-unknown-unknown` targets, Node, Viceroy, wrangler), then
run the scripts from a clone on the WSL native filesystem for fast builds.

---

## Coding Conventions

### Rust Style

- Use the **2024 edition** of Rust.
- Prefer `derive_more` over manual trait implementations.
- Use `#[allow(lint)]` to suppress lints when necessary.
- Use `rustfmt` to format code.
- Invoke clippy with `--all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`.
- Use `cargo doc --no-deps --all-features` for checking documentation.

### Type System

- Create strong types with **newtype patterns** for domain entities.
- Consider visibility carefully — avoid unnecessary `pub`.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone, Eq, Hash, PartialEq, derive_more::Display)]
pub struct UserId(Uuid);
```

### Function Arguments

- Functions should **never** take more than 7 arguments — use a struct instead.
- Take references for immutable access, mutable references for modification. Only take ownership when the function consumes the value.
- Prefer `&[T]` instead of `&Vec<T>`.
- Never use `impl Into<Option<_>>` — it hides that `None` can be passed.

### `From` / `Into`

- Prefer `From` implementations over `Into` — the compiler derives `Into` automatically.
- Prefer `Type::from(value)` over `value.into()` for clarity.
- For wrapper types (`Cow`, `Arc`, `Rc`, `Box`), use explicit constructors.

### Allocations

- Minimize allocations — reuse buffers, prefer borrowed data.
- Balance performance and readability.

### Naming Conventions

- Avoid abbreviations unless widely recognized (e.g., `Http`, `Json` — not `Ctx`).
- Do not suffix names with their types (`users` not `usersList`).

### Import Style

- No local imports within functions or blocks.
- `use super::*` is acceptable in `#[cfg(test)]` modules only.
- Never use a prelude `use crate::prelude::*`.
- Use `use Trait as _` when you only need trait methods, not the trait name.

### Comments and Assertions

- Place comments on separate lines **above** the code, never inline.
- All `expect()` messages should follow the format `"should ..."`.
- Use descriptive assertion messages: `assert_eq!(result, expected, "should match expected output")`.

### Crate Preferences

- `log` (with `log-fastly`) for instrumentation.

---

## Error Handling

- Use `error-stack` (`Report<MyError>`) — not anyhow or eyre.
  - **Exception**: `crates/trusted-server-adapter-spin/src/lib.rs` entry point returns `anyhow::Result` because `edgezero_adapter_spin::run_app` forces this type at the WASM FFI boundary. Do not use `anyhow` anywhere else.
- Use `Box<dyn Error>` only in tests or prototyping.
- Use concrete error types with `Report<E>`.
- Use `ensure!()` / `bail!()` macros for early returns.
- Import `Error` from `core::error::` instead of `std::error::`.
- Use `change_context()` to map error types, `attach()` for debug info.
- Define errors with `derive_more::Display` (not thiserror):

```rust
#[derive(Debug, derive_more::Display)]
pub enum MyError {
    #[display("Resource `{id}` not found")]
    NotFound { id: String },
    #[display("Operation timed out after {seconds}s")]
    Timeout { seconds: u64 },
}

impl core::error::Error for MyError {}
```

---

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests live alongside source files under `#[cfg(test)]` modules.
- Uses **Viceroy** for local Fastly Compute simulation.
- GitHub Actions CI runs format and test workflows.
- Structure tests with **Arrange-Act-Assert** pattern.
- Test both happy paths and error conditions.
- Use `expect()` / `expect_err()` with `"should ..."` messages instead of `unwrap()`.
- Use `json!` macro instead of raw JSON strings.
- Follow the same code quality standards in test code as production code.
- For JS tests: use `vi.hoisted()` for mock definitions referenced in `vi.mock()` factories.

---

## Documentation Standards

- Each public item must have a doc comment.
- Begin with a single-line summary, blank line, then details.
- Always use intra-doc links (`[`Item`]`) for referenced types.
- Document errors with `# Errors` section for all fallible functions.
- Document panics with `# Panics` section.
- Add `# Examples` sections for public API functions.
- Add `# Performance` sections for performance-critical functions.
- Skip documentation for standard trait implementations unless behavior is unique.
- Use `cargo doc --no-deps --all-features` to verify.

---

## Logging Practices

- Use `log` crate level-specific macros: `log::info!`, `log::debug!`, `log::trace!`, `log::warn!`, `log::error!`.
- Provide context in log messages with format strings.
- Format messages with present-tense verbs.
- Use `log-fastly` as the backend for Fastly Compute.

## Other guidelines

- Use US English spelling everywhere: code, identifiers, comments,
  documentation, tests, commit messages, and configuration. For example, write
  `color`, `behavior`, and `optimize`, not `colour`, `behaviour`, or `optimise`.
  Where a term comes from an external source (for example the IAB TCF purpose
  names), match that source's spelling even when it is not US English.
- Use only example or fictional information in comments, tests, docs, examples,
  and similar non-runtime materials. (eg. for urls use: example.com domains only)
- Do not write or commit real domains, customer names, credentials,
  configuration values, or other potentially sensitive real-world information in
  comments, tests, docs, or examples.

### Permission model terminology

Permissions are the primitive. A provider declares the permissions it requires
(`required_permissions`) and the system decides whether each is _set_. Consent
is only one of several ways a permission may be established. Country or
jurisdiction rules (a `Granted` group baseline), legitimate interest, or
configuration can set a permission with no consent at all.

- A provider that needs nothing **requires no permission**. Never write that it
  "runs without any consent".
- A gated provider **runs once its required permissions are set**, by whatever
  method.
- Reserve "consent" for the consent subsystem (`consent/`, `ConsentContext`,
  GDPR and TCF strings) where it genuinely means a consent signal. In the
  permission layer prefer "permission", "set" / "unset", and "signal" (consent
  is one kind of signal, alongside privacy and opt-out signals).

---

## Git Commit Conventions

- Be descriptive and concise.
- Use sentence case (capitalize first word).
- Imperative, present-tense style.
- No semantic prefixes (`fix:`, `feat:`, `chore:`).
- No bracketed tags (`[Docs]`, `[Fix]`).
- Follow the detailed guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

Good: `"Add feature flags to Real type tests that require serde"`
Bad: `"fix: added feature flags"`

---

## Provider Architecture

Each vendor-differentiated capability is pluggable behind its own trait, so a
deployment selects an implementation and the core stays neutral:

| Capability            | Trait                                    | Selector            | Built-in (core)                         | Vendor / host crates         |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Edge Cookie identity  | `EdgeCookieProvider` (`ec/provider.rs`)  | `[ec] provider`     | HMAC, client-fixed (opt-in, no default) | `crates/edgecookie/<vendor>` |
| Device detection      | `DeviceProvider` (`ec/device.rs`)        | `[device] provider` | User-Agent only (default)               | `crates/device/<vendor>`     |
| Geo / IP intelligence | `PlatformGeo` (`platform/traits.rs`)     | `[geo] provider`    | Disabled, no location (default)         | `crates/geo/<vendor>`        |

Principles for adding or changing a provider:

- **Core stays neutral.** The trait and the host-neutral default live in
  `trusted-server-core`. Host-specific and vendor implementations live in their
  own crates and are injected by the adapter (for example `build_device_provider`
  and `build_geo_provider`), so core never depends on a host SDK or a vendor, and
  the default request path makes no host-specific calls.
- **Providers read request evidence, not a fixed parameter set.** A provider must
  be able to see everything about the request it needs (User-Agent, headers, and
  host signals such as the TLS JA4 and HTTP/2 fingerprints) through an evidence
  abstraction rather than a hard-coded struct of fields. Host signals come from
  the host (the Fastly SDK) and are opt-in, so a neutral provider triggers no
  host fingerprint calls.
- **Providers are separated by capability but composed per request, and one may
  need another's output.** Geo resolves the country and region the permission
  model uses, and the permission model gates whether the Edge Cookie provider
  runs. Device signals gate Edge Cookie writes (the browser / bot gate). When
  several vendor providers share a backend (for example a vendor's Edge Cookie,
  geo, and device provider on one cloud pipeline) they share a single call per
  request rather than calling independently. Give a provider the inputs and
  upstream results it needs explicitly, rather than having it reach into globals.

---

## Integration System

Integrations register in Rust via:

```rust
IntegrationRegistration::builder(ID)
    .with_proxy()
    .with_attribute_rewriter()
    .with_head_injector()
    .build()
```

- Integration IDs match JS directory names: `prebid` (deferred), `lockr`, `permutive`, `datadome`, `didomi`, `testlight`.
- `creative` is JS-only (no Rust registration); `nextjs`, `aps`, `adserver_mock` are Rust-only.
- Integrations opt into deferred loading via `.with_deferred_js()` on the registration builder. Deferred modules are served as separate `<script defer>` tags instead of being concatenated into the main bundle.
- `IntegrationRegistry::js_module_ids_immediate()` returns modules for the main bundle; `js_module_ids_deferred()` returns modules loaded with `defer`.

## JS Build Pipeline

- `build-all.mjs` discovers `src/integrations/*/index.ts` and builds each as a separate IIFE.
- Output: `dist/tsjs-core.js`, `dist/tsjs-{integration}.js`.
- `build.rs` auto-generates `tsjs_modules.rs` with `include_str!()` for each discovered file.
- `bundle.rs` provides `concatenate_modules(ids)` and `concatenated_hash(ids)` APIs.
- Runtime: Rust server concatenates core + enabled integration JS files at request time.

## Configuration Files

| File                  | Purpose                                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |

---

## CI Gates

Every PR must pass:

1. `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
2. `cargo clippy-fastly && cargo clippy-axum && cargo clippy-cloudflare && cargo clippy-cloudflare-wasm && cargo clippy-spin-native && cargo clippy-spin-wasm`
3. `cargo test-fastly && cargo test-axum && cargo test-cloudflare && cargo test-spin`
4. `cargo test --manifest-path crates/trusted-server-integration-tests/Cargo.toml --test parity`
5. JS build and test (`cd crates/trusted-server-js/lib && npx vitest run`)
6. JS format (`cd crates/trusted-server-js/lib && npm run format`)
7. Docs format (`cd docs && npm run format`)

---

## Standard Workflow

1. **Read & plan** — understand the request, explore relevant code.
2. **Get approval** — for non-trivial changes, present a plan first.
3. **Implement incrementally** — small, testable changes. Every change should
   impact as little code as possible.
4. **Test after every change** — run the target-matched adapter test for the
   code you changed; before PR handoff, run the full CI gate list above.
5. **Explain as you go** — describe what you changed and why.
6. **If blocked** — explain what's blocking and why.

## Verification & Quality

- **Verify, don't assume**: after implementing a change, prove it works. Run
  tests, check clippy, and compare behavior against `main` when relevant.
  Don't say "it works" without evidence.
- **Plan review**: for complex tasks, review your own plan as a staff engineer
  would before implementing. Ask: is this the simplest approach? Does it touch
  too many files? Are there edge cases?
- **Escape hatch**: if an implementation is going sideways after multiple
  iterations, step back and reconsider. Scrap the approach and implement the
  simpler solution rather than patching a flawed design.
- **Minimal changes**: every change should impact as little code as possible.
  Avoid unnecessary refactoring, docstrings on untouched code, or premature
  abstractions.

---

## Subagents

For complex tasks, use specialized subagents (`.claude/agents/`):

| Agent             | When to use                                                          |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `build-validator` | Validate build across native + wasm32-wasip1 targets                 |
| `code-architect`  | Analyze architecture, suggest improvements                           |
| `code-simplifier` | Find and simplify overly complex code                                |
| `verify-app`      | Full verification pipeline (build + test + lint)                     |
| `pr-creator`      | Create well-structured pull requests                                 |
| `pr-reviewer`     | Staff-engineer PR review with inline GitHub comments (user approves) |
| `issue-creator`   | Create GitHub issues with proper types via GraphQL                   |
| `repo-explorer`   | Explore and answer questions about the codebase                      |

### Multi-Phase Workflow (for complex tasks)

1. **Phase 1 — Investigation** (read-only): launch subagents with
   non-overlapping scopes. Each must return concrete findings with file paths.
2. **Phase 2 — Solution proposals** (no edits): propose minimal fix strategies.
   Compare tradeoffs before coding.
3. **Phase 3 — Implementation**: pick one plan (smallest safe change) and
   implement centrally.
4. **Phase 4 — Verification**: run `verify-app` or `build-validator`.
5. **Phase 5 — Ship**: use `pr-creator` to create the PR.

**Default trigger**: use this workflow when work touches 2+ crates or includes
both runtime behavior and build/tooling changes.

## What NOT to Do

- Do not add unnecessary dependencies without justification.
- Do not use `println!` / `eprintln!` — use `log` macros.
- Do not use `unwrap()` in production code — use `expect("should ...")`.
- Do not use thiserror — use `derive_more::Display` + `impl Error`.
- Do not use wildcard imports (except `use super::*` in test modules).
- Do not commit `.env` files, secrets, or potentially sensitive real-world
  information in comments, tests, docs, examples, or configuration files.
- Do not make large refactors without approval.
- Always run tests and linting before committing.
